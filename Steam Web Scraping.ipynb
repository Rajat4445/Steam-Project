GOTY right here, Posted: 15 SeptemberAbsolute Amazing, stunning game play. I feel as miserable as I do when I play a real trombone.I cant believe I can finally call myself a true tromboner. Thank you, thank you so much.I've lost feeling in my fingers., Posted: 15 SeptemberIt is the perfect game. I will be upset if Trombone Champ does not win game of the year 2022., Posted: 15 SeptemberIt's exaclty what i asked for and its the most beautiful thing i've ever seen, Posted: 15 SeptemberI am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and trombone and started playing but I was stuck on how to hit the correct notes. I asked my Son for help and he did. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories., Posted: 16 SeptemberAs a trumpet player, I can say that this is 100% accurate to how a trombone would sound if I played it. I appreciated the 100%, totally accurate trombone facts.All jokes aside, this game is great and unique. I deeply appreciate the amount of effort that went into the game. It's accurate (as much as a rhythm game can be for an instrument like trombone) and it also embodies the type of humor I've found trombone/low brass players to have., Posted: 16 SeptemberGreat game, would be cool to have a onlie gammode to duet with friends and stuff.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Posted: 15 SeptemberHololive, Posted: 15 September5 years in the making since the critically acclaimed hit game Ping Pong League hit shelves!, Posted: 16 SeptemberIf you're a fan of Hololive, this is a pretty safe buy. I don't know if they're planning on adding further content to this game, but if not, I would say the price is probably more like $5 worthy than $10. This is only a 3 hour experience, and thats ifyou go after the other endings. The animations and art are relatively nice. I came across a bug where I fell through the floor at one point, and had to restart, but it's not that big of a setback thanks to the chapter select. Even though I play on a high-end PC, the levels,the shrine in particularlag pretty badly for about 10 to 20 seconds at the beginning of the level. That's nitpicky though, overall this is a fun experience for Hololive fans and I recommend it. If you aren't a Hololive fan and was just interested in the horror aspect, you can probably skip this., Posted: 15 SeptemberPlease buy this game and help fund HoloEarth, Posted: 15 SeptemberSuisex., Posted: 15 SeptemberBetter than buying a monkey., Posted: 15 SeptemberI like the part where I was walking toward woman that was scariest part. (I can't interact with them), Posted: 15 Septemberman, I love Kanashe's definitely an angel 😇, Posted: 16 Septemberdo not let this video game distract you from the fact that pekora bought a monkey, Posted: 16 SeptemberIt's good and it's hololive. And also, Glasses are really versatile. First, you can have glasses-wearing girls take them off and suddenly become beautiful, or have girls wearing glasses flashing those cute grins, or have girls stealing the protagonist's glasses and putting them on like, \"Haha, got your glasses!\" That's just way too cute! Also, boys with glasses! I really like when their glasses have that suspicious looking gleam, and it's amazing how it can look really cool or just be a joke. I really like how it can fulfill all those abstract needs. Being able to switch up the styles and colors of glasses based on your mood is a lot of fun too! It's actually so much fun! You have those half rim glasses, or the thick frame glasses, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a buffet. I really want Luna to try some on or Marine to try some on to replace her eyepatch. We really need glasses to become a thing in hololive and start selling them for HoloComi. Don't. You. Think. We.

       "      <td>[Posted: 15 SeptemberAbout an hour in already and I really love it.What I liked - I love the character builder system so far. Lots of choices. Quite a bit of learning by using which works great for me, I enjoy that exploration of it. Optional missions that are replayable and with some secrets to find is also quite fun.Monsters already have seemed varied and different. I enjoy that it's not all just a different color and call it good.I was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed the art style.The game feels like the true tactics games, with fun RPG elements in how you set up your characters. If you really like tactics games, you don't really need to read any longer, it's worth the cost.Concerns - There are a few UI aspects I wish they'd adjust, and the speed you scroll on the map you may want to change to the slowest possible as it's quite fast on any other setting. Took a little bit to get used to, but once I got things where I wanted them it was fine.The Meh - The story so far seems pretty cut and dry. You are effectively to weak to fight the big bad while they do some terrible stuff. But they let you live so you can get stronger and defeat them. (Guessing). However! This is an early thought and not only could there be a twist I haven't seen. Also, really it doesn't bother me., Posted: 15 SeptemberThe first tactics game I ever played was Final Fantasy tactics. Have always been a big fan of the genre. Absolute Tactics *absolutely* does the genre justice ;D. Would definitely recommend if you're a tactics fan and looking for something with a fun story line and accessible mechanics. Well done!, Posted: 15 SeptemberBought it day 1 and played for an hour. The game runs alright on the steam deck. No issue booting it up and the controls work just fine.The game in itself seems alright so far. Nothing too crazy either. The plot feels like it's going to be cliché as hell and the gameplay in itself is nothing more nor less than you'd expect from the genre. I'm a bit confused about the class leveling system though and I wish the menu you get in between main story missions were a bit more than \"just a menu\". No world map, just a couple stores, a sidequest list and your roster and that's it. I think any character can equip any sort of equipment as well, which is a bummer. I'd have liked see a bit more diversity in what and who could equip different sorts of equipment, but hey.I guess it'll scratch the itch for a dozen hours, but I would wait to get it on sale with a 50% discount at least. Not worth it at full price., Posted: 15 SeptemberMy first impressions are largely positive.In terms of combat, there doesn't seem to be the level of complexity seen in Final Fantasy Tactics or Fell Seal. That said, what's there is pretty good. Each of the main characters has a unique attack pattern and a few unique attacks. Outside of that, classes come in the form of manuals which each character can equip two of. These provide both stat bonuses and additional skills. Enemies tend to be vulnerable to skills or basic attacks, which can end up heavily influencing positioning. Certainly a nice wrinkle. In terms of skills, you have your standard array of ranged attacks, aoes, buffs, debuffs, etc. The buffs and debuffs  I've encountered so far are impactful. I've only played a few maps so far, but there seems to be a focus on having a variety of scenarios. For instance, one mission had 3 phases: an initial \"stealth\" phase, a large castle fight, and finally an escape in a carriage.I'm enjoying the art quite a bit. It's certainly a step up over many other indie strategy games, and has it's own charm.The writing so far has been fine. I saw another review say that it was bad middle school fan fiction level, which is way overblown. A lot of the characters have a fairly strong anime trope feel to them. The main character is a head strong hero who won't listen when someone says to stay back. One of the main antagonists is a petulant young witch/demon/not sure yet and comes across a bit strong. I'm sure this somewhat tropey style will come across negatively to many, but I don't mind it. While the main story is coming across as fairly standard fair to this point, I'm still enjoying myself. I doubt there will be anything ground breaking, but that's fine. There's a nice bit of a tongue in cheek humor to it that's had me grinning fairly often.I'll update the review if my opinion changes as I go further, but I wanted to go ahead and give some first impressions for potential buyers., Posted: 15 SeptemberProduct received for freeTo give this game a fair review, keep in mind that this game was developed by a gargantuesque team of two people.The game is promising.From hanging on the game's official forums, the developers show interest in making additional content for the game and I think there lies the issue: the game doesn't need additional content, but a better user experience.The game feels like a cask beer. A treat for the amateur, but a failure for the uninitiated.For the fans of the genre, the maps are elegantly furnished and decorated and well thought out. The art style is beautiful.Overall, the game offers you a good turn-based tactical RPG experience with a cliché story to tie it up.The story telling and world building is awkward, but functional. There is a nice unit customisation feature in the otherwise dry inter-mission menu., Posted: 15 SeptemberProduct received for freeThe best way that I can describe this game is essentially as one step up from those RPG Maker games. The character portraits, the animations and most importantly, the writing for this game are all akin to that you would find in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fanfiction of god knows what. This game is bad.Before anyone has a heart attack as they always do when I haven't 100% a game 3 times in the span of 24 hours before I review it, I played to the first big boss of the game and will not be finishing it. I do not like this game, and I played a good bit past the point of refunding being possible without having fun. That alone is enough to leave a review, but I'm going to detail some of my issues with this game both for the prospective buyers and for the devs if they happen to see this. I'm not trying to be insulting when I talk about Absolute Tactics, but this game really is not good and especially since they are charging 25 bucks for it? No way in hell I'm giving them a pass here, even if I didn't have to pay for it, anyone else that wants this game will have to and thats a crime.First and foremost, lets talk gameplay. This is modeled after games like FF Tactics and Fire Emblem (a stretch on the second one), and yet it does nothing to shake up the genre. I will say, I did not in fact get to the \"war\" stages they advertise as their unique inclusion to the genre with tons of units on screen at once, but with the way they handled combat in the early stages, I imagine there isn't much nuance to those fights beyond there being a lot of units on screen at once. The level design, which is one of the most important aspects of a tactics game, is quite bad.While the levels actually look decent, they never do anything interesting to limit or push your combat capabilities. If you have a 2 square attack the enemy is 2 squares away, even if they are on a massive incline where your attack shouldn't reach, your attack will hit. You can shoot through things and hit over things, which isn't a problem inherently, but ANY attack can hit ANYwhere as long as it is in range, and even with the base squad of characters, every single one of my characters had something that could hit over or behind obstacles by the time I hit the first big boss. You might see this as a positive, but it makes the game far too easy, which brings me to my next point.There is no urgency whatsoever in this game in the absolute worst way. There is no turn limit, there is no time limit, there is nothing to push you into the enemies. You can move one block at a time if you want and the enemies won't come to you until you cross certain thresholds in the level which are invisible, but very easy to decipher. I didn't want something to attack me at one point so I brought my frontline up to the edge of where I thought their aggro range was and then had my 2 fast characters running around in the area I had cleared already getting all the collectibles and items. It took 6 turns of them running around, and THEN I advanced.There is also a really annoying obsession the game seems to have with making you do turn based movement all the time. There was one point where there was a fight 3 turns worth of walking away. Instead of just having a cutscene, they made me walk my way up to the fight and interjected dialogue in between each turn, it was obnoxious, and this happens a lot.This brings me to my final point, and honestly the worst part of this game. Even while a tactics game that isn't very tactically deep is a sin, the story of this game that forces you to engage with the story at every turn? I cannot stress this enough, this is middle school fanfiction levels of writing.There was maybe 2 or 3 lines I chuckled at, and the rest of it was just word vomit trying to seem like some grand adventure. Its like those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ isekai anime but without the fanservice and fun fights to save it. This game takes its story as though you will be totally invested, and does nothing to actually invest you in it. There were typos, and it was predictable enough that 20 minutes in I could tell you the entirety of the plot without skipping a beat. The characters are awful, the dialogue is worse, and there is nothing redeeming about the story here. While I absolutely have stories in games that are awful but the game remains good (Neon White comes to mind, cringe dialogue, dope game) this game is interwoven with the story much to its detriment. You can't escape it, you can't skip it.There are some good points to this game, and it is entirely possible that there are some big twists in gameplay and the story that turn this game around, but almost 3 hours in and it did nothing to impress me. The music is fine and the voice acting is decent, but there is only one voice acted character in the entire game, and beyond that... I struggle to find much else redeeming. This entire game is an exercise in tedium, and forgets to do the one thing that games are supposed to do. It forgets to be fun.If you made it this far I'd appreciate you following my steam curator page. I review lots of games indie and not with consumers in mind. Normally I put in a good bit more time into a game before I review it, but this is just a hobby for me so if something really is just not doing it for me (like this game) I just play up to the 2 hour mark or a good stopping point so I can give enough information for prospective buyers. I have a few more games like this one (but better hopefully) lined up to review so follow along for that, thanks for reading.Check out my steam curator page for more reviews on (mostly) indie games:https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42143664/, Posted: 15 SeptemberI’ve been looking forward to this game for awhile because I love SRPGs and graphics that look like high quality hand-drawn animation like Arc Systems Works games, for example. Absolute Tactics doesn’t disappoint and is a worthy successor to classics like Fire Emblem, Vandal Hearts, Shining Force and Final Fantasy Tactics. It’s able to take the best from these famous games that probably inspired it while adding plenty of unique and interesting features of its own. Between its stunning visuals, great gameplay and fun dialogue, this is a game that’s not to be missed. Considering this is the first title from Curious Fate, their future looks bright, indeed!, Posted: 15 SeptemberWas really hyped about this game. In the 20 minutes I played I found issues with my controller, it changed my display resolution, it really disappointed me with the quality of the animations and it softlocked me in the menu that I opened to see if the \"Keyboard and Mouse\" had some keybinds because it seemed like it was only using my mouse which was terrible to play with.Can't recommend the game in its current state but I really hope they fix this issues., Posted: 15 SeptemberProduct received for freeFull Gameplay Walkthrough -https://youtu.be/F_GEg4SndG0One of the very Best Turn Based Strategy Games of 2022, everything is top-notch about this game, from aesthetics to the plot.You also have an extra free slot for a class where you can add a class of your liking so max 2 classes for each character, you can experiment around to make your builds.The Plot is unique and exciting and it makes you ask several questions throughout the journey, pushing you to play the game even more.A large variety of monsters and unique attack skills with different characteristicsThere is also a shop after each mission where you can upgrade your characters - you can buy better weapons armour , skills, etc0 Bugs or glitches so far and it's very well optimized.Overall Its a great game and you should definitely play this !!Score - 9/10 ( Go for it ), Posted: 15 SeptemberGreat music, fantastic visuals]</td>\n",

Well idle numbers go brrrrrrrrr will please you., Posted: 16 Septembermonetized like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile game, utter lack of QoL (other than the QoL they hold hostage behind a paywall), ridiculous number formarts. I played the game years ago on kong and thought to see if it improved any with the steam release. Of course it hasn't., Posted: 15 Septemberfeels like idleon but more idle, good., Posted: 15 SeptemberIt’s pretty great but it’s missing sex, Posted: 16 SeptemberTLDR: Bang for buck, this is the game.I've played through this game multiple times on the phone version (years of playtime), and I'm excited to finally get the chance to play it on PC too. With that said, I feel like I have enough experience with this and similar games to give this one a resounding endorsement.If you enjoy incremental progress games, this is probably one of the best you'll find out there. While idling is definitely a possibility, one of the biggest reasons I've kept playing for so long is because the game really lets you play to the activity level you want. If you want to play actively all day, the game really will let you play actively. If you want to check in and then quit out to let idle time accumulate, you'll progress that way too. Being able to take things at your own speed depending on mood and availability makes this a great game to keep around.Another big selling point for this game is depth. This game has been through updates and expansions for years, and the game systems have a way of evolving and deepening the further along you get. Systems gradually unlock more and more content, and various challenges that you take at your own pace provide interconnection between different branches of the game.Most importantly: The game is designed with the intent that you can play through and beat everything without spending a single dollar. The first time I bottomed out and maxed everything, I didn't spend a single cent. There are in game mechanics and minigames that award a steady stream of gems, more than enough to get any powerups necessary to reach end game content. It's a single player game. Spend as much as you want or nothing. Anyone complaining that it's pay to win: yes, you can drop crazy money on gems if you want, nothing stopping you. But if you need that kind of speed then why even play an incremental game?It costs nothing to try, so try it here or maybe pick it up for mobile and give it a once over next time you're dumping out., Posted: 16 SeptemberOnly playing it because it gives rewards for a different game, Posted: 16 Septemberhow to open auto?]</td>\n",

The art is stunning - each new card is a joy to behold, the portraits all exude charisma. And the writing got a few good chuckles out of me. I was a bit worried about how complex the gameplay might be, but it gets very intuitive once you make it past the tutorial phase. It plays very smoothly - the kind of game that makes you want to cancel your week-end plans :), Posted: 15 SeptemberThis one goes straight in my top favorite card games. The narrative aspect is perfect, like the dialogues and the narrator, not too much, just the perfect amount. The clever way of combinning the skills and item cards with map cards and/or event cards. There are some REALLY fun combination to be made! The fact that you can literally try to be a hero or a \"villain\" so to speak, by killing everyone in your path or stealing everything, it's just so much fun. The music and ambiences are great and fit perfectly. I really dig the visuals, not only the cards but the different types of background for each part of a mission and the change of mood... Man, it's just... Perfect!Clearly you guys put a lot of effort into this game., Posted: 15 SeptemberIf you are looking for a \"slay the spire\" combat card game, this is not that game.This game is a resource management / choose your own adventure / choices matter  story driven card game.You will be choosing different story scenarios and trying to make the best out of a bad situation.PROSGreat art, writing, musicCharming charactersVery polished game (no bugs, good ui. etc)Choices matter A LOT (scenarios you choose, objectives you complete, who you save, who you kill, etc)Many characters with different functions, abilities, and strengthsCONSSome puzzles could be better explained but this is solved by pressing the \"light bulb\" multiple times for different hintsCombat is basic and almost non-existent as it's almost always better to mercy / intimidate / resource the enemy awayFor the price, this game is well worth the play through., Posted: 15 SeptemberGreat game.  Kept me up too late.  Bedtime for Bonzo.  But, again, great game., Posted: 16 SeptemberJust played for an hour before going to work and felt compelled to drop by to say how much I love this game. It's super hard to summarize what it actually is: a card game, but also a storytelling machine, but also a strategy game, but also a CYOA... Anyways, it's fresh, it's unique and it's highly recommended!, Posted: 15 SeptemberI usually return card based games because I get tired of their mechanics. But I try them. This one I won't return - it is great!This game gives the player interesting ways to explore and play using the cards. And it gives the player lots of choices. It feels like a choose your adventure RPG with excellent writing and art.There is really not a thing I can complain about here. If there was one thing it would be that I wish I could save the game when I want to. It auto-saves after you complete a region which usually takes between 15 to 30 minutes. But the gameplay is great so it's not really an issue.But honestly its amazing. 9/10 for what it is., Posted: 16 SeptemberProduct received for freeOne of the best Card Games of 2022, it's my second favorite after Voice Of Cards Beasts of Burden, that game is on a completely different level but this one is also pretty great and both of very unique in terms of what they offer !!

For now, what you need to know is: she wanted it back.”Gameplay video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhuAZwxORMcMetal: Hellsingeris a rhythm first-person shooter where you fire, reload, slaughter and dodge on the beat. The original soundtrack contains some of the best metal music that you’ll ever hear, made by the very best metal musicians out there. I wanted to play this game ever since it was revealed more than 2 years ago at E3, and it definitely delivered.Pros✔️ Fast and addictive rhythm-based combat, with smooth movement and gunplay✔️ Fantastic soundtrack; Metal is love. Metal is life.✔️ Amazing visuals.✔️ Lots of replay value.✔️ Butter-smooth 60 FPS.Cons❌ The story/narrative is nothing special; not great, not terrible.❌ Bland boss design, the same boss can be seen in 7 different levels.StoryYou play as The Unknown, a half-demon half-human that was imprisoned by the Red Judge, the ruler of hell and the one that stole her voice. You return to hell to slay enemies (demonic and angelic), kill the Red Judge and reclaim your voice back, with the help of a talking skull, as well as the cutscene narrator and weapon used in the game, called Paz. That’s the story for you in a nutshell, not the best out there, but it helps keep the players engaged. You can find more about the story and lore in the Codex.GameplayYou have to sync your shots, quick reloads (pressing the reload button as soon as the yellow beat goes inside the reticle) and dashes to the beat of the music, and the rhythm detection reticle, which serves as a guide to help you match your actions. The game calls it “Beat Matching”. It sounds hard but it becomes pretty easy once you get the hang of it. When an enemy is severely wounded, you can perform a slaughter (on beat as the rest), which is similar to DOOM's glory kills, and you can regain some health from it.The game has a Fury multiplier, and it moves up and down depending on your beat matching; the more in sync you are with the rhythm, the more intense the music will become, which will, in turn, increase the multiplier (from 1x to 16x maximum) as well as the score. However, going off beat or taking damage will disrupt the multiplier and decrease it.The final score at the end of every level is compiled from slaying demons, destroying objects, damage you’ve taken, total headshots, multi-kills, hit streak (total on beat hits without going off beat), time spent on the level, time spent at 16x fury and kills on the beat. You can still kill enemies and do any action without being in sync, but you won’t get a lot of points from it.There’s a diverse range of challenging enemies, such as gun-wielding demons (sometimes carrying a shield too), fast stalkers that can teleport to your location, strong behemoths that can remove half of your health if you aren’t careful, and Seraphs that can beam you from afar. You will constantly get outnumbered, so keep moving, shooting, and dashing.There are a total of 6 weapons in the game. Two permanent weapons that you'll always have in your arsenal are the sword and Paz, a headbanging skull that shoots fireballs, and it is the least powerful weapon, but you can still use it (shoot on beat) to keep your fury up even when enemies aren’t around. You will be able to carry two of the four remaining weapons that you’ll unlock in the first 4 levels; a pump-action shotgun, a dual pistol, a crossbow that fires explosive bolts, and dual boomerang-style blades. Each weapon has a powerful ultimate attack that can be charged up by performing successful-on-beat hits.After completing a level, three new challenges (also known as Torments) open up, and each challenge will reward you with a new sigil, or an upgrade to an existing one. There are a total of 7 sigils that give you an extra buff, help you increase your score, or save you from anything that can interrupt your hit streak/multiplier. You can equip two sigils in a level. Those challenges are completely optional and you don’t have to play them to beat the game, but those sigils are useful if you are thinking of getting your name at the top of the leaderboards.Aside from the tutorial, there are 8 levels of Hell where each one ends with a boss, and first 7 features the Judge’s Aspect, and they look the same but with very slight design changes and a different ability or two after every level. They were fun, but the design of the final boss looked mediocre, but the fight was an adrenaline rush, and it featured the best song in the game.SoundtrackThe soundtrack is awesome, definitely a 10/10 in my book. It features multiple metal bands and singers, such as Matt Heafy (Trivium), Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy), Randy Blythe (Lamb of God), Tatiana Shmayluk (Jinjer), and many others.  The music starts off light once you begin a level, keep slaying enemies on the beat and it will get more intense. They’ve done a fantastic job of blending music and FPS elements, making it feel like the weapons are instruments and part of the song.Graphics &amp; Level DesignThe game looks great. Thankfully, you don’t need a heavy graphics card to play the game, even on high settings. There are 8 Hells (levels) and they look somewhat similar, but with different skyboxes or weather. They are very linear so there is no point in exploring, and each one takes about 10-15 minute to complete, depending on how fast you can kill.TechnicalMy PC:RTX 3070, Intel I9-10850k, 32 GB RAM, Windows 10 Home, 1080pThe game ran great, with butter-smooth 60 FPS. no bugs to report.Additional Details:Total playtime8.5 hoursMBK or ControllerMBK, definitelyOffline modeYesSteam Deck40 FPS at the lowest settingsGames SavesNoneFinal ThoughtsThe game has 8 levels, aside from the tutorial, and it took me 5 hours to complete all levels and their challenges. This is another fantastic rhythm FPS game with fun combat, a fantastic soundtrack and great visuals. Having said that, the boss design is bland and the story is mediocre. In addition to the custom music modding support that they’ll be adding later, I hope they’ll release more levels in the future, and new songs to jam on to while slaying demons.for more quality reviews like this, follow our curator page,Summit Reviews., Posted: 15 SeptemberI can't believe this amazing metal album comes with a free game!, Posted: 15 SeptemberFull gameplay on beast mode on my youtube channel: TheBaldMan:https://www.youtube.com/c/TheBaldMan~ DIFFICULTY ~🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it🔲 Easy🔲 Normal☑️ Hard🔲 Dark Souls~ GRAPHICS ~🔲 MS Paint🔲 Bad🔲 Meh🔲 Graphics dont matter in this game🔲Good☑️ Beautiful🔲 Masterpiece~ MUSIC ~🔲 Bad🔲 Not special🔲 Good☑️ Beautiful~ STORY ~🔲 This game has no story🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story☑️ It's there for the people who want it🔲 Well written🔲 Epic story~ PRICE ~🔲 Free🔲 Underpriced☑️ Perfect Price🔲 Could be cheaper🔲 Overpriced🔲 Complete waste of money~ REQUIREMENTS ~🔲 You can run it on a microwave🔲 Average☑️High end🔲 NASA computer~ LENGTH ~🔲 Very Short (0 - 3 hours)☑️ Short (3 - 15 hours)🔲 Average (15-50 hours)🔲 Long (50-90 hours)🔲 Extremely long (90-110 hours)🔲 No ending~ FUN ~🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry🔲 Hard to enjoy🔲 Repetitive☑️ Actually pretty amusing🔲 Ride of your life~ REPLAYABILITY~🔲 It's a one-time experience☑️ Only for achievements🔲 If you wait a few months/years🔲Definitely🔲Infinitely replayable~ WORTH BUYING ~🔲 No🔲 Wait for sale☑️ Yes, Posted: 15 SeptemberAnother great FPS-rhythm game just likeBPM: bullets per minutebut much MUCH better!

Great atmosphere, fun combat, lots of extra content, &amp; total homage to 1980s Italian horror. Definitely a bang for your buck for 6-8 hours of content, Posted: 14 SeptemberHazy night, gory night,Night of infernal flames,Open tombs, desecrated flesh,Maggots, ghouls, zombies in sight.Load up your gun,Aim always for the head,The last thing you want,Is to join the undead.Now shall I grapple with the fiend,This will be my last stand,Wish me well, my friends,I'll be down by the Gates of Hell., Posted: 15 SeptemberYou got guts coming into these woods with cheeks like that(‿ˠ‿), Posted: 14 SeptemberThis game is absolutely mental in the best way possible. Right off the bat it throws you into a world of uncomfortable campy Italian apocalypse giallo and just keeps turning up the spooky meter as the minutes go by. The zombies are frightening and slow. Fulci slow.  There's a bunch of filters that let you zone in on a specific TV era for max immersion. They're really excellent and works the best out of any game (The Quarry, Resident Evil, Dying Light) that offers the option to change visuals. I haven't put much time into it, but i'm excited to feel so existential and depraved of hope from this game when I can give it more. DEFINITELY PICK IT UP!!!, Posted: 15 SeptemberFinally!This is an amazing survival horror game. It's refreshing to play a game where your choices and skill in gameplay actually matters again. Every single bullet counts and that's the way survival horror should be! I've always been the type of guy to save every bullet so this is my kind of game. It totally flies off the rails by the end but I honestly really appreciate the apartment level more than any other. Just you, your guns, your wits, and your problem-solving skills. Hell yeah.The story is somewhat simplistic but I prefer it that way. I'm here to have fun, not compare and contrast themes with H.P. Lovecraft. The graphics are retro and look great! This game takes inspiration from early Italian horror flicks so the environments feel nostalgic in a weird way. If you think the graphics look bad, you're just not into the aesthetic and that's fine.There are two negatives for me.First negative: There was a big bug in the janitor office that caused my game to hang up and have to restart the entire area but I think it's already been fixed and I'm willing to forgive that because I played it the second it came out.Second negative: I think this game would have been a lot more fun if it weren't presented in the format of 'levels'. Basically, there are no save points. If you complete a level, you've unlocked it and can replay it with a set amount of ammo and weapons. This did take away from my overall experience because I'd go from saving a ton of ammo to starting a new level with only a few bullets.Definitely better than Bloodwash and probably my favorite game published by the awesome folks over at Puppet Combo.Thanks for making games!This is my full playthrough / experience with the game:https://youtu.be/nn1VMcMq9YA, Posted: 15 SeptemberProduct received for freeAfter Bloodwash, I couldn't wait to see what Jordan King came out with next! Teaming up again with Henry Hoare, Night At The Gates Of Hell is an absolutely terrifying experience but wonderfully executed to not only show the game's inspiration from Italian horror zombie flicks but also to give the players nostalgia to some of the older zombie games we have played. (Also Booty Creek Cheek Freak being bundled is too good 10/10) I will say this game made it a bit more challenging as you have limited ammo, limited use knives and zombies will only die either with a headshot or being stabbed. It's not impossible to take down the undead (even me with bad aim could get them) so it does let you enjoy a bit of both combat and the storyline without stressing out much. I loved it and as always, I can't wait to see what's next!, Posted: 14 SeptemberProduct received for freeIt's pretty good, kind of made me anxious during the first proper stage at times.However, going through doors is a little finicky where I had to crouch after opening a door to move so keep that in mind while playing if you get stuck., Posted: 15 SeptemberThis is great. Good atmosphere, actually spooky, very cheap, metroidvania elements., Posted: 15 SeptemberThis game was really good! I enjoyed being chased by The Booty Creek Cheek Freak, Posted: 15 SeptemberHilarious game really entertaining, super campy and jank in the best way. Love all the creepy characters and was stoked to see Stan the man return. Booty Creek Cheek Freak made me snort, both extra modes are great, main story is abit longer than other Torture Star/PC titles and was tons of fun. Good bang for your buck imo, was a great way to spend a few hours. More pls 8/10]</td>\n",

Let your citizens walk freely on pedestrian-only streets while you build brand new city-service buildings and 3 new special districts.🌆Get excited for the brand-new wall-to-wall specialization and a whole collection of new buildings, assets and props to detail your cities. Create, manage and progress your pedestrian areas, small pedestrianized neighbourhoods, park &amp; bus plazas and huge downtown commercial strips just to name a few!Accompanying Plazas &amp; Promenades are two unique Content Creator Packs, 2 Radio Stations &amp; a free update!, How much Ram does the new dlc Plazas and Promenades need? I have 32 gig ram and I am now using 28 ram, computer is still running well the citiy skylines, but what after the new dlc?. I have already 5 earlier dlc., Hello again city-builders! Plazas and Promenades is almost here, and I’m so excited that you will soon be able to enjoy it. As with every major expansion, we have a little something for all players who own the base game, and today’s Dev Diary is all about the free content!Let’s start with a convenient new feature,Quit After Saving, which can be enabled when saving your city. As you may have guessed from the name, it will quit the game once it finishes saving, allowing you to skip the process of saving, waiting for it to finish just to select exit and get a warning about losing progress if you haven’t saved. Very handy when you’re done playing and just need to save and quit the game.Check the box before saving to quit automaticallyNew roadsAs roads are a central part of any city, we are expanding the options even further with 18 new roads. We had a look through the road types you have wished for over the years and added as many of them as we could in this patch. This includes a series of roads with bus-priority lanes, which can be used by other vehicles if they need to turn, and for the first time ever bus-only lanes and roads!In theSmall Roadscategory, you can soon find the new small road with wide sidewalks and small one-way road with wide sidewalks, as well as small roads with a concrete median, grass median, and tree median. For the busier parts of the city, you can grab the small 4-lane road or the 4-lane road with bus lanes, or expand your one-way road system with the 3-lane one-way and 4-lane one-way roads.Stylish and practical selection of new roadsNew in theLarge Roadscategory are the new large roads with medians, featuring 6 lanes in two directions separated by either a concrete median, grass median, or tree-lined median - the latter of which comes in both a regular version and a bus-priority lane version.Expand your busy roads using these new optionsLastly, we have a handful of new Highways for you using the all-new bus-only lanes. Create a high-speed bus network with the two-way bus-only expressway which comes both with or without sound barriers, or integrate bus-only lanes into your existing highways with the highway with bus-only lanes, both with or without sound barriers. And to connect them all you can use the bus-only expressway ramp.Build a bus rapid transit system using the new highwaysWe look forward to seeing how your cities will benefit from these new options and which ones will be your favorites. And while it isn’t a road we do have another network for you, namely the new one-way metro tracks, allowing you more control and customizability over your metro network.Now, all there’s left to do is check out the tutorial video by Overcharged Egg, have a look at the patch notes below, and wait for Plazas and Promenades to release.

Today’s dev diary is all about the new district specializations and new maps, so let’s check them out.First up we have the three newWall-to-wallspecializations that can be used for residential, commercial, and office zones. They unlock at Milestone 6 - Big Town, along with high-density zoning. Each specialization features 48 new modern low-rise buildings to create a unique area in your city. As a new feature to the game, these buildings have murals, which are randomly selected each time a building spawns to create additional variation and color in the neighborhoods.A sprawling wall-to-wall neighborhoodThe new wall-to-wall specializations don’t just look cool, but as a specialization, they also work slightly differently from regular zone types. To reflect their modern construction, these buildings have a lower risk of catching fire, but as they’re built close together, fires spread more easily between them. So make sure to keep a few fire stations nearby just in case they do catch fire.Like previous specializations, they can be found in the Districts and Areas menu under each zone tab and are applied to a district by selecting the specialization and clicking on a district. For pedestrian areas, however, there is no need to create a district, as specializations can be applied directly to the area. If a district and a pedestrian area overlap and have different specializations applied for a specific zone, like commercial, the pedestrian area specialization will be the one used.New mapsNow we can’t have an expansion without new maps for you to build on! For Plazas and Promenades, we have 5 maps for you to choose from, featuring different landscapes and themes.First is the temperate map ofCape Apple. You start centered on a long peninsula with easy access to the surrounding landmasses, creating an excellent environment for a thriving metropolis. Take advantage of the ship connections to bring in tourists or set up a bustling industry along the coast as you build your new city.Cape Apple offers wide open spaces ready to be developedNext, we journey to the tropics withCoastal Gem. It features long wide beaches and lots of open space to build a city on. You can expand inland to reach some of the area's many ore deposits or claim the coastline and benefit from the added land value of waterfront property.Coastal Gem lives up to its name with its beautiful beachesGondola Islandsis the first of our two new European maps. It is made up of a cluster of islands of varying sizes only connected to the mainland by a bridge. Whether you create island communities focused on walkability using pedestrian areas or connect the many islands using the new roads, Gondola Islands will shape any city built here.The island cluster of Gondola Islands have much to offerThe boreal map ofOracle Lakeoffers a large valley filled with forests and lakes for you to build your city on. Base the city’s industry on the large forests, extract the abundant ore in the area, or focus on creating a vibrant tourist destination. The choice is yours.Oracle Lake features many scenic viewsLast but not least is our second European map,Splitz Tributary. Build your city at the foot of the mountains or along the banks of the rivers meeting here. With lots of buildable land, your city can take many forms.Splitz Tributary is an ideal location for a new cityThis concludes our Dev Diaries for the new content coming in Plazas and Promenades. On Tuesday, we’ll have a look at the free update that adds something new for everyone, as well as the patch notes so you’re completely up to date before release. Below Overcharged Egg has another tutorial for you, showing off the new content. Enjoy!, Posted: 12 SeptemberHonestly, I love this game but I'm so tired of Paradox's DLC approach and the lack of updates on a Cities Skylines 2 where we don't have to worry about mods working within the limitations  of an aging game., Posted: 13 Septemberwould be better if they didn't want you to spend over $200 on dlc packs for longevity of the game, Posted: 14 SeptemberLoading issues, I have been wondering if there is really any need to select a style except to apply a certain image or appearance. I mean, does the lack of or use of a style have any technical function? Will the city, a mod or an asset actually be affected in a negative way if a style is is not used?\\n\\nI try to imagine building a rural community when the only style enabled is hi-tech influenced(or vice versa). \\nYippee I-A, ctrl-alt-delete just doesn't seem to work in my brain.\\n\\nI probably shouldn't have brought this up; no..., It broke Node Controller, TMPE, and many other mods\\nDammit, This update that I havent seen has really knackered my game up. Mods clashing. Expected to remove etc etc. Just leave the game as it was, How do these work? i cant get them to deliver goods/collect garbage and they somehow block garbage trucks  from spawning]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Posted: 14 SeptemberI finaly founnd my Judgment on PC!P.S. LS's soundtrack is just a masterpiece (just like this whole game), i would like to recommend to watch this composer appreciation video from SnowiestAngeman:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QadtEiz5Ga4, Posted: 14 SeptemberI have played this game for around 200 hours or something on PS5 and I can say that it is my second favorite game of all time behind only Metal Gear Solid 2, which is a bias pick. I think the gameplay, combat, and side content in this game tops all of the other games in the franchise. It improves on everything in the first Judgment, and while there are a few things that can be argued that the first Judgment does better (Side Cases and Friend Mechanic imo,) I still think this game is an all time classic that should be experienced.I made a 36 minute YouTube review if you would like a super in depth and spoiler free look at Lost Judgment and everything it has to offer. If not, then my TL;DR is that this game is a 10/10 masterpiece and I recommend it wholeheartedly.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZAk-0pUIM, Posted: 14 SeptemberMy Judgment was lost.Thanks RGG for bringing this to pc, Posted: 15 Septemberif you aren't sold on the prospect of beating up high schoolers, then you have lost your judgment, Posted: 14 SeptemberRAIL kara hazureta furyouhin no norainu saDakedo kantan ni wa TAIL wa furanai zeYES MAN ni narisobireta(woah oh oh, woah oh, we are bad boys)Waru ni nokosareta \"No\" to iu na no JusticeWow, Breakin' the lawBreakin' the world kowase(breaking the world)kirisake TendernessWow, Breakin' the ruleRoppou zensho ja shibarenai hanran bunshi saFuriageta nigiri kobushi ga oretachi no JUDGEMENT, Posted: 14 SeptemberIt's a great time to be a fan of RGG studios., Posted: 14 SeptemberFINALLY IT'S ON PC, I had played it on PS5 for about 50 hours barely touching the story and now I gotta grind my stuff back to where I was.. :( BUT AT LEAST IT'S ON PC and it RUNS AMAZING, Posted: 14 SeptemberI have the PS4 version of the game and actually beaten the game there. But i won't spoil story things here.But first things first, thank you SEGA for casting whatever black magic to convince the certain agency that held this game and Judgment from appearing in PC.How's the game?If you don't really like Yakuza 6/Kiwami 2 (which i am not a big fan of) combat, this game IMPROVES upon that combat a lot, as they added more fighting style in the game. In previous game, there's two combat styles, which is Tiger and Crane, both are different but unfortunately Tiger have a move that is pretty broken. But now in this game, both Tiger and Crane are pretty balanced, as they both even gained more options, also there are 2 new fighting style for this entry, a snake that have major focus on countering, and boxing which personally i haven't use a lot but from what i've seen, it is pretty broken as you can easily juggle some enemies with it. (and its originally a DLC style)Graphic wise, its Dragon Engine. The quality of Yakuza games honestly can be a hit or miss (like K2 green filter is very questionable) and personally? Lost Judgment is a hit for me.For content, this game is VERY PACKED with it. A lot of mini games and the school stories stuff, combined with side cases. Not to mention that you not only visit Kamurocho, you also get to Yokohama (as majority of game takes place there)As for story, some people actually prefer the previous entry more, but for me, I think that I prefered this plot more as I found the premise of the plot pretty grounded, and relatable.Also do i need to say somehting about the music? Well it's still a banger. Like give some of the soundtrack a listen, you'll know why. It just still have that quality that the main Yakuza/Like a Dragon games have.This game was my GOTY in 2021. And I think it will be my GOTY for this year as well (sorry Elden Ring. You're still a great game)PS: It ran well in steam deck. Finally Lost Judgment/Judgment on the go., Posted: 15 SeptemberI have always suggested the Judgement series to everyone, but I always get a bit sad how not everyone has access to them due to them being PS exclusive at the time. Now that they're finally on PC, the long-awaited dream of me suggesting this game to literally everyone has finally come.I have accumulated over 150+ hours on both Judgement(2 playthroughs) and Lost Judgement(4 playthroughs) on the PS5 in just 2 months of getting them, and now another playthrough of LJ on PC! I can never say this enough, but the gameplay and story of both games are simply fantastic. Not to mention the super stylish moves you can pull off(and of course juggling lol).A few complaints I do have for the PC port are that pre-rendered cutscenes are locked at 30 FPS and playing anything above 60 FPS will make certain things janky/weird. An example of that would be the Snake Style parry. It works normally on 60 FPS, but starts being weird at 120 (however still playable). Another issue that has plagued other Dragon Engine games would be how charged finishers(Tiger Style and maybe Snake Style specifically for LJ) would freeze the character in place if played at an uncapped framerate. So if you're having that problem, I suggest limiting your framerate to 120.Those issues aside, amazing game and story-writing. All around lovable and very well-written characters. Would definitely recommend to everyone and especially to people who enjoy stylish brawler combat set in the RGG world., Posted: 14 SeptemberSo good I re-bought it the moment it released for PC.Without a doubt the best game in the franchise, and RGG Studio's best work. Here's hoping we get a third game in the Judgment series.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Posted: 13 SeptemberI'm not good at writing detailed reviews, so this is all I'm gonna say.In a world dominated by sprawling open world games with realistic graphics, this humble retro platformer managed to keep my anticipation for it higher than anything else for the 6 years I was waiting for its release. And you know what? It's already worth it. Highly recommend it whether you're already a fan of the first game or if you're new to the series because it delivers the same fast paced, incredibly fun gameplay of the first game with vast graphical improvements, *many* new features, quality of life improvements, and of course, the new story.Hats off to GalaxyTrail for setting a fine example for the gaming industry. It took a long time, far longer than even they anticipated, but they used that time to make sure they delivered a quality game to the fans.It's really nice to be back in Avalice., Posted: 13 SeptemberBeen waiting since 2015 when I played the first one.  Like to so far., Posted: 15 SeptemberFreedom Planet 2 is like Freedom Planet but with more Freedom. And more Planet. And more good.It's good.Go play it., Posted: 13 SeptemberJust finished the game. Absolutely fantastic, and a worthy sequel to the original. It can get hard as balls sometimes, however, just keep that in mind., Posted: 13 SeptemberAwesome game - awesome sequelFreedom Planet at one time divided Sonic fans into two camps. The first saw a solid game with their own style, the others turned on the morons and started yelling about plagiarism and parasitism on Sonic ... which, in fact, has long gone to ♥♥♥♥. However, Freedom Planet has received the recognition and love it deserves, building up a fan base that is finally looking forward to the sequel.PlotThe story starts three years after the first game. The grown up and prettier heroines are attacked by unknown robots that destroy their house. Forced to cooperate with the royal nobility, they investigate a series of incidents involving the same robots, which slowly but surely leads to key events.GameplayCompared to the first game, the combat system has been noticeably upgraded here, adding a defensive move, as well as lowering the limitation for old abilities, allowing the use of much more advanced attack combinations.The levels here are divided into two types:1) Combat - where we have to run through vast locations, making our way through their unique opponents in order to defeat the big bosses at the end.2) Urban - the most beautiful residential settlements with many characters who are ready not only to talk, but also to trade.In addition to the standard levels, there are also secondary activities, such as an arena with various modes, among which I especially liked a kind of PvP analogue that allows me to push the protagonists head-on.Graphic artsStunning sixteen-bit visuals have been pumped to perfection here, giving out not only magnificent detailed cities with civilians, but also combat levels, each of which lives according to its own laws, always remaining in motion.SoundtrackThe musical accompaniment of Freedom Planet immediately wanted to add its own playlist and the sequel took its well-deserved place in it. The soundtrack not only harmoniously combines with peaceful towns and dynamic levels, but also literally caresses the ear from the first seconds, and the sound effects are my respect.ResultsFreedom Planet 2 perfectly demonstrates to us those rare cases when the sequel not only does not lose the dignity of the original, but also multiplies them many times over, making literally everything better. This is a true creation of people who love their work and their project, and this same love does not let go even after a complete passage, as it was with the first Freedom Planet., Posted: 13 SeptemberLilac is best girl, Neera is stinky., Posted: 13 SeptemberTHE SOUND TRACKS ARE STILL BANGERS AFTER 8 YEARS!?!?, Posted: 14 SeptemberWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAHHHH BABY THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WOOOOOO, Posted: 15 SeptemberI'm not big on the 2D Sonic titles (or just in general), but the gameplay of the first Freedom Planet really enamored me and the sequel is no different.The way you create speed and carry momentum in this game is so satisfying with your attacks generally having some sort of movement property. My favorite example being Milla's Shield Burst that's so strong, it blasts you in the opposite direction you shoot it. Learn to chain them together along with her Yoshi-like float that keeps your momentum, you'll be flying across the stage at mach speed if you're good enough. Legitimately some of the best movement mechanics and physics I've ever experienced in a platformer.On top of that you have the absolutely gorgeous pixel art and incredible soundtrack. Even if you're not a fan of the Sonic titles like me, I'd still 100% give it a try., Posted: 13 SeptemberGlad my favorite indie game finally got its sequel. Goes hard so far and definitely has a lot of noticable improvements over the first title.]</td>\n",

While well-depicted, they are comparatively bland.- Disappointing finale that feels somewhat rushed and obscure.🟨Bugs &amp; Issues🔧Specs- Subtitles can’t be disabled.- Motion blur can be set to ‘Low’ but never completely disabled.- Mouse sensitivity resets upon each level transition and needs to be re-applied.- 3900X- 2080Ti- 32GB RAM- SSD- 1440pContent &amp; Replay Value:It took me 6 hours to complete SCP: Secret Files (SCPSF), taking extra time to read all documents, dialogues and lore files I encountered. Given the entirely linear content, I don’t see a reason to replay once finished.Is it worth buying?Yes. The base price of 12,50€ is fair for this amount of content and quality. I can recommend buying without discounts.Verdict: GoodRating Chart HereA competent rendition of the SCP universe. It’s interesting, varied and involving, however it fails to harness this setting’s full potential.Follow our Curator page,Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews regularly.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2862523444In-DepthPremise, Setting &amp; WritingFreshly graduated from MIT, protagonist Karl Astana accepts a work offer from a mysterious company called ‘SCP Foundation’; his soon-to-be job? Archive management at one of the Foundation’s countless sites. This isn’t a run-of-the-mill archive either, Karl will soon find out, as it contains information on so-called ‘anomalous objects’: items with paranormal properties that, for one reason or the other, pose a risk for the population and need to be Secured, Contained, Protected (SCP).As an archivist, Karl won’t be involved in the dangers of direct field work, but still will have to deal with disturbing (and sometimes nonetheless dangerous) information he is tasked with analyzing and cataloging for posterity. SCPSF aims to recreate a ‘realistic’ work environment with this perspective and does so rather well, as Karl won’t only engage in his work but also have chats with colleagues he’ll eventually get to know, participate in e-meetings, receive calls and so forth. All of this contributes to giving a sense of immersion, as do all the custom interfaces that mimic internal software, detailed decor and paperwork with actual lore printed on it.The environments and the way operations are conducted, from your desk job to the interactive recollection of events detailed in the various reports, feel congruent to the SCP lore; as a longtime purveyor of this fandom, I couldn’t help but notice the great care and attention to detail put into most elements. The weaker link in all this would be the selection of anomalies, which are pretty good but don’t manage to fully convey the severity, desperation and most of all sacrifices Foundation personnel as a whole have to commit to on a regular basis.There surely were better, more interesting choices among the endless lore at the devs’ disposal. This fault is partially remedied by the solid atmosphere and care put into expanding each story’s self-contained microcosm, but still those more accustomed with this fandom will probably think of dozens better SCPs to feature.Exploration &amp; Collectible FilesIn most instances, you’ll explore each setting in first person perspective (some exceptions apply) in a generally-linear fashion, with very few secondary areas if any at all, mostly containing additional lore files or achievement-related collectibles. The incipit will always be the same: understanding what happened during the events described in a report. For that you’ll change perspectives and play as one or more persons of interest involved in that specific case, be that a Foundation agent, a D-Class prisoner or other figures.There won’t be enemies or other dangers in most cases during exploration, save for those specific phases that revolve around avoiding an active threat, which are however sparse. At times, failing to promptly trigger an interaction can result in death, rolling you back to the last crossed checkpoint - you’ll never lose much progress given their abundant frequency.Interaction is limited, with only essential machinery or prompts being accessible in an otherwise static world - this is within expectations for what is, at the end, a narrative adventure. Instead of additional direct interactions, SCPSF uses indirect narration and environmental elements to deepen the storytelling for the more observant players. This is further compounded with plentiful optional material to peruse, such as recordings and written documents that also double as collectibles of sorts.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2862523817Puzzles &amp; MinigamesOne of SCPSF’s key characteristics is variety: each of the various stories you’ll experience will contain minigames and puzzles each with their own unique mechanics built up from scratch. From driving a delivery truck to collect hazardous materials, to matching a melody’s notes in a rhythm game or stealthily passing anomalous monstrosities, there won’t be a shortage of diverse activities. This feature allows breaking the general conventions of narrative adventures (aka ‘walking simulators’) with novelty at every turn, while at the same time keeping the general narrative coherent.These minigames and puzzles will never be too demanding challenge-wise and the penalty for failure, as expected from this genre, is often minimal. All in all they have enough variety to break the main pacing, but at the same time are never so over-intrusive that they overstay their welcome - a mark of well-planned design.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2862523225, Posted: 13 SeptemberI am a toaster, Posted: 14 SeptemberI was excited about this game because I'm a huge fan of the SCP Foundation. However, this game doesn't incite the same feeling of excitement and intrigue I get when reading a good SCP article. It just felt... kinda boring. The game itself isn't bad, the graphics were decent and I don't think I encountered any bugs. I think the main issue is that the 5 SCPs they chose to focus on were lackluster. I'd be curious to know why they chose some of these when they had so many more interesting options available. I did appreciate the artistic choices they made, each SCP story had a distinct feel to it. They all felt unique, utilizing different art styles and tones. In the end, the gameplay behind each story just felt plodding and the content of the SCPs wasn't exciting enough to make up for it.There were some minor things that bothered me as well. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad, distinctly fake enough to pull me out of the moment. The character's footsteps, for example, just sounded really artificial and not in time with the character's movements. Normally this would be easy to ignore if they weren't so LOUD. That's another thing, the volume was really inconsistent. In one story, the music was so loud I could barely hear the characters speak and adjusting my audio settings didn't really fix the issue. Also, during one story you have to wait for text to type out before moving on and it's so SLOW (I'm already bored, stop torturing me). Not sure if there's a button to make it move faster, but if so I couldn't find it. There are also parts of the game where you're literally just reading SCP articles. It's under the pretense that you're an archivist and I get that they were trying to make you feel like an actual employee, but the 'archiving' you do is just dragging and dropping files. It's like fake gameplay and while I enjoy reading SCP articles, if I wanted to do that I can just go to the wiki.I feel bad giving this game a thumbs down because I didn't hate it (it's more meh than bad). I did get the sense that the developers were trying to make something good and I don't think the price is unreasonable.***My total playtime is probably 4-5 hrs for one playthrough, not 9.1. I tend to leave a game on when I'm doing other stuff., Posted: 14 SeptemberFull gameplay on my youtube channel: TheBaldMan~ DIFFICULTY ~🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it🔲 Easy☑️ Normal🔲 Hard🔲 Dark Souls~ GRAPHICS ~🔲 MS Paint🔲 Bad🔲 Meh🔲 Graphics dont matter in this game🔲Good☑️ Beautiful🔲 Masterpiece~ MUSIC ~🔲 Bad🔲 Not special🔲 Good☑️ Beautiful~ STORY ~🔲 This game has no story🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story🔲 It's there for the people who want it☑️ Well written🔲 Epic story~ PRICE ~🔲 Free🔲 Underpriced☑️ Perfect Price🔲 Could be cheaper🔲 Overpriced🔲 Complete waste of money~ REQUIREMENTS ~🔲 You can run it on a microwave🔲 Average☑️High end🔲 NASA computer~ LENGTH ~🔲 Very Short (0 - 3 hours)☑️ Short (3 - 15 hours)🔲 Average (15-50 hours)🔲 Long (50-90 hours)🔲 Extremely long (90-110 hours)🔲 No ending~ FUN ~🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry🔲 Hard to enjoy🔲 Repetitive☑️ Actually pretty amusing🔲 Ride of your life~ REPLAYABILITY~🔲 It's a one-time experience☑️ Only for achievements🔲 If you wait a few months/years🔲Definitely🔲Infinitely replayable~ WORTH BUYING ~🔲 No🔲 Wait for sale☑️ Yes, Posted: 13 SeptemberProduct received for freeAn Outstanding SCP Experiencehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGDd8Zj0jdwSCP: Secret Files is an absolutely brilliant collection of short experiences based on the SCP Foundation wiki.Playing as a new employee of the SCP Foundation, we're put in front of a PC in the archive department, instructed to go through and make amendments to various files. What I really appreciated about this is that you really do feel like an employee of the foundation. You'll be checking on the status of SCP sites, attending training, speaking with co-workers on the instant messaging service and performing data entry grunt work in between chapters etc. It's all very immersive.Each chapter of the game has it's own visual style, gameplay mechanics, but also tone and theme. While leaning mostly in the direction of horror, there are sections that depart from the scares and feel more akin to other genres. If you've played What Remains Of Edith Finch, it's a bit similar.Although differing from chapter to chapter, each of the sections tell their story with impressive visuals and audio, while also showcasing interesting and often unique gameplay. It all seems to run very smoothly too.Each of the chapters are fun and memorable in their own way. It was a delight to play through each of them.If you're interested in SCP or you're a horror fan, what are you waiting for?GET THIS GAME!, Posted: 15 SeptemberWARNING: this game plays more like a visual novel focused on storytelling. If you come here expecting it to play like the other SCP games (which focus on surviving/fighting), you'll be disappointed.I was waiting for months to play this, and I must say, the only disappointment was that it wasn't longer. The way information is presented is engaging, and I never felt frustrated or bored even during the text intensive parts. This game also feels like multiple games combined into one, and somehow they managed to make it work. The artstyle and direction are gorgeous, so praise there as well.As for the storytelling itself... this game explores the SCP world in an honestly unique way. If you know 0 about SCP, or you only know the popular stuff from containment breach, you need not worry - the game guides you through what or who each SCP is, making it so you don't need to know a lot about the world to understand it. If you do know your \"lore\", the game is also incredible (the here be dragons segment will make anyone who  already knows the story emotional, for example).I would go more in detail, but I do not wanna spoil the game for anyone, since it's so story oriented. All in all, if you're looking for a SCP game focused on the SCPs themselves but NOT on survival horror or fighting entities, this is the game for you., Posted: 15 SeptemberSteam Page makes it sound like a collection of stories by multiple people that will keep you interested in the style of the Dread X series, however the actual game is short bursts of gameplay followed by either text based discussions or people talking at you, none of which can be skipped., Posted: 13 SeptemberI played for an hour in which no actual gameplay occurred. It started to become clear to me that this was a visual novel told though very lightly interactive parts. If you're looking for an SCP visual novel this should be great for you, but if you're hoping for anything resembling gameplay you're going to be out of luck., Posted: 15 SeptemberI am a toaster, Posted: 13 SeptemberFirst Impressions: (First Hour)The first level honestly has proven to me that this form of story telling is the definitive way SCP stories can be brought to life in such a epic and immersive way. I love the heavy emphasis on making me feel as if I am actually a part of the foundation very similar to how the actual SCP website reads. This adds an extra layer of immersion making me feel like i am a part of this world. The art style, story direction and Narration kept me on my toes from start to finish. As someone who hasn't read a ton of SCP entries, learning more about obscure anomalies in this manor was a truly great experience.I hope that this concept of a Twilight Zone/Alfred Hitchcock show Format is utilized more within the SCP universe I truly believe that this is the best fit for this universe within the gaming sphere.. heck even television. I hope this game does well so we can see maybe a Season 2 for this game or even a sequel. Well Done!]</td>\n",

I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Europa Universalis IV and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories., Posted: 12 SeptemberThis game is good with the expansions, buy it if you have the money for at least half of them, otherwise the you'll miss basic content like playing as a colony or having better UI with useful commands. this is a good game but a shameless cashgrab, Posted: 14 SeptemberI still haven't completed the tutorial, as the tile states i have done the missons but cant build or even find the unit availabe anywhere, WITH THE LATEST UPDATES, THE AZTECS ARE USING A CANNON, RIDING A HORSE.

       "      <td>[Posted: 12 SeptemberI played through the Demo extensively, going through each of the three Class options and exploring what I could within the Demo's time limit of a few in-game Days. I had a lot of fun exploring the different options each Class brought to the game.Now that the full game has released, I decided to pick the Scribe Class, as it appeared fairly useful in the Demo. There are three difficulty settings, the easiest of which completely eliminates the full game's time limit of 40 in-game days. The hardest difficulty cuts this to 30.The UI is gorgeous, and the text can either be displayed as an old-school pixel font or a more elegant modern font. Everything is pretty intuitive, and it won't take more than a minute to navigate the entirety of the menus. The Journal option is SUPER in-depth, and a must for referencing names and places to NPCs.The ambient guitar music needs mentioning: it's not very repetitive, and it's actually quite soothing. You'll be hearing a lot of it, but with different tunes--occasionally some drums for battle, or bells/chimes for more pensive areas.It's a Choose Your Own Adventure game, with a lot of modern Quality of Life features (quick save/quick load, a fantastic repository of knowledge a few clicks away, an enormous Glossary for any lore-based terms, etc). I was told that this game has about 30 hours of gameplay, and I can believe it--especially if you play as the other two Classes, and the mechanics between the Mage, Scribe, and Fighter all vary greatly. I definitely recommend Roadwarden, especially for $10.EDIT: With some extra time to think about it, I wanted to add some things:There are some sections of the game where you will need to type out an answer to a prompt (I alluded to this feature at the end of my third paragraph). For example, you can ask an innkeeper for some gossip on characters you've met, or you may be in a strange room and the game will ask you to name what you look at. For the former, you can reference your Journal and look at Character names and type them into the prompt. For the latter, you'll need to use some detective skills and describe where in the room you'd like to look. It isn't always so simple: you can mention names to the innkeeper that aren't in your Journal yet that you only heard in passing, for example. The prompts want specific answers, but are relatively forgiving (a funny example is when a character asked me if I knew where they were from, and I had misspelled the name of their village... They corrected me, but said I was \"close enough.\" I thought that was clever).In addition, I overlooked a key aspect of the game: the graphics themselves. It's all pixel art--a lot of greens, browns, yellows, greys... But the detail of the art is stunning. Coupled with the text, you can tell exactly what's going on in the landscape you see before you. It's also incredibly satisfying to reveal parts of the otherwise black map. There's a true sense of exploration here--neither you nor your character have any clue what you have gotten yourselves into, and it's nice to have some evidence of your progress after a particularly grueling day. There are also plenty of shortcuts you can create or discover, which will make your travels much more efficient: very important, if you're playing the normal or hard difficulty.This is kind of fun, so I'll come back to this when I keep finding important things to note. Still loving it! Try the demo!, Posted: 14 SeptemberFor a game like this, you want to evaluate it along three lines. First, the quality of the writing. Second, the impact of the choices you make on the narrative. Third, the quality of the sandbox design.The writing is excellent, evocative yet punchy, avoiding flowery or purple prose. It engages in worldbuilding in a very natural fashion, never indulging in infodumps but giving you a sense of elements of the world as they become relevant. At every point I get the sense that the writing respects my time as a reader, never wasting it or lingering unnecessarily, while still giving me a strong sense of atmosphere and style.The choices feel meaningful, though this might be an illusion and I may have to revisit this after some more time with the game. I do get the sense that I'm free to make allies or enemies as I see fit, and to approach quests in my own fashion (or not at all) depending on how I prefer to engage with the world. Even the choice of what to prioritise seems to matter, since some quests come with time limits.Finally, the sandbox. The map isn't Elden Ring-huge, but it's sizeable and teeming with flavor. The characters I interact with feel lively and memorable, each with their own agenda and worldview, and even the minor locations so far in my playthrough have been interesting. I won't say there's no filler, but every location is well-thought-out and serves a purpose.In short, a fantastic game. Possibly the best of this kind I've played., Posted: 12 SeptemberVery enjoyable so far. Very polished.The UI is great and has lot's of detailed information about everything. Inventory, journal, bestiary, stats and more. Great sounds and good art to allow your imagination to fill in the rest. Will update more after my first full play thru.But I am enjoying it thoroughly~, Posted: 12 September5 hours in (out of apparently 30+) and I'm already a spy for the mayor of one village, slowly helping her build an army to force the swamp village to stop using reanimated corpse workers, among another dozen equally-interesting interconnected storylines, 10/10, Posted: 13 SeptemberWhat a great hidden gem! I love a good story, and I'm super engaged and invested in the subtle lore and world building Roadwarden offers. Gameplay is literally just making choices and managing your stats and items, but super fulfilling. The NPCs are so well fleshed out and have so much more to offer. I played 7hrs straight and Absolutely love this game.FYI: It has a built in  console if you ever need to tweak things, by pressing shift+o (the letter o).A few helpful commands are:- pc_hp = x (for example 4) for health- mana = x (magic)- coins = x- cleanliness = x- armor = x- pc_food = x (nourishment)items are all in the form of item_nameoftheitem = xso for example item_rations = x, Posted: 12 SeptemberWriting is solid and the story is keeping me interested so far. Quality artwork that gives you a framework and let's your imagination build from there. It's a nice change of pace., Posted: 14 SeptemberThis is an interactive book game. Don't buy this if you aren't prepared for a LOT of reading., Posted: 12 SeptemberFor someone with massive ADHD but a huge desire to try this out, I really hope the devs consider using the ADHD friendly font-technique calledBionic Readingsoon. It's hard to comprehend some things simply because I have to reread it, but so far I'm LOVING the game. Incredible writing.EDIT: Bionic Reading: check it outhere[www.theguardian.com]SECOND EDIT: Another helpful tool for my fellowneurodiverse friends[app.bionic-reading.com], Posted: 14 SeptemberI use this game as a tool to improve my english speaking skill., Posted: 12 SeptemberPlayed on the Steamdeck. I played both versions of the demo and really enjoyed both. I was looking forward to the release of the full game and so far it's been excellent. I really like the balance of visual novel and rpg. The setting is the kind of low fantasy I love. The developer really poured his heart and soul into this game and it shows. Highly recommended!Technical note: I'm playing on the steamdeck. Performance is great and the joystick selection is a little fiddly, but touch screen works really well and feels natural.Give the game a try!]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Posted: 10 SeptemberIt's The Witness. It would be impossible to be any more The Witness without adding an extended lecture about philosophy. If that sounds good to you, then you will enjoy it., Posted: 10 SeptemberI enjoyed a lot of the puzzles here.I do think that some of them require intuitive leaps that are not altogether satisfying - they feel like trying to guess the designer's intent rather than actually work things out logically. Even after finishing the areas, there are two puzzle types that I suspect I still understand \"wrong\", even though my understanding got me through them (at least I hope I understand them wrong, because if I don't, those are very obtuse, very inelegant rules).There is one area near the center of the map where I had to make what amounted to an aesthetic guess at what I was supposed to do. It was not a huge leap, but I found it very unsatisfying.There are also several \"Tower of Hanoi\" puzzles - puzzles where I saw the crux of it, I saw what I was supposed to do, but it was extremely tedious to manipulate all the pieces into position (looking at you, mushroom platforms). I know some people enjoy that kind of sequencing puzzle, but it was not at all what I'm looking for in a game like this.The game will inevitably be compared to the Witness, and it is just not nearly as tightly designed as the Witness is. Still, it is probably the next best thing, the art is absolutely gorgeous, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone who wanted more of these kinds of puzzles., Posted: 9 SeptemberProduct received for freeDisclaimer: I did some prerelease playtesting, so might be biased.I loved Taiji. It's similar to The Witness, in terms of both puzzle type and having to explore different sections of the world. I especially like the high density of puzzles, without filler or fluff. The world has an aura of mystery, which makes for many cool moments as you discover new areas or secrets.Puzzle difficulty is moderate -- about the same as The Witness, easier than Stephen's Sausage Roll or Baba is You. You have to discover the puzzle rules yourself (there is no text or instructions in game), and there is well-planned puzzle progression so you gradually improve your skills and knowledge. For those that want it, there are secret/extra puzzles that are more difficult.Best advice I can say is if you liked The Witness you'll like Taiji, and vice versa. Though realize Taiji is made by a one-man indie developer, so it's smaller scale / no first-person 3d graphics compared to the Witness, but that also makes the gameplay a little tighter., Posted: 9 SeptemberIf The Witness is one of your favorite games, don't miss this. It feels very similar, even though it's different enough that it's a totally distinct journey of discovery., Posted: 13 SeptemberIf you're here then you're a puzzle lover, so I'll cut to the chase. Taiji expects you to discern the rules of its puzzles on your own (a la The Witness). The issue, however, is that the game does a very poor job of communicating these rules in a natural manner. You will almost immediately begin brute forcing puzzles and then attempting to reverse engineer the mechanics, and this does not slow down ever. Even when working on the last of the game's 445 puzzles, you'll still find yourself weighing whether it'll be faster to figure out the last third of a puzzle or just work your way through the 128 permutations you've narrowed it down to., Posted: 9 September今天早上买的，一直沉浸到下午两点，witness-like的解谜是真好玩，这可比读《精神现象学》有意思多了Anyone who is interested in how language works should play witness-like games such as this one, while progressing in the game, you will always be astonished at that human mind faculty of getting a sense from everything.This is really a MEANINGFUL game., Posted: 11 SeptemberAll killer, no filler., Posted: 10 SeptemberAmazing game. Greatly inspired by The Witness but with an identity of its own. Not as many puzzles, but WAY less filler and many MANY secrets to find. 10/10, Posted: 13 SeptemberA panel-em-up island getaway where you have to flip flop these screens to make wires glow. Very delightful, and a luscious treat for the eyes. Some people say it's the same as the 1985 Harrison Ford movie, \"Witness\" but honestly I think they're only similar in a cursory way. Highly recommended (the game, though the movie is okay too)., Posted: 12 SeptemberPlay Witness - Draw linePlay Taiji - Draw boxLine - One dimensionBox - TWO dimensions2 &gt; 1Conclusion?

The exploration and combat are fun and provide a fair challenge, although the controls will feel a bit stiff at first.  If you're in the mood for another souls-like and think the aesthetic and setting look interesting, you will probably enjoy this, but don't expect anything that breaks the mold.  A warning though, the game is oddly intensive in its graphics demands.  I have been able to run it fine, but others have had difficulties., Posted: 8 SeptemberThe story, atmosphere and combat feel and sound great but in it's current state I simply cannot recommend it.Constant stutters and frame drops and as soon as I left the beginning area I am getting constant crashes which is simply inexcusable with my hardware I am running.Hopefully I will be able to go back to it after some serious patches but for now, refunded.Hardware:CPU I9 12900kGPU RTX 3090RAM 32GB of DDR5 @ 6000MHZ, Posted: 12 SeptemberI finished this game last night and can now honestly put my thoughts into this review. Lots of good and some bad. I do recommend this game but on sale and for everyone interested to watch game-play reviews before buying.This game really needs a demo. The price is steep I will admit but it depends to on what you want to get out of this game. For myself it is important to have a good narrative and visuals but for others the combat is their main focus.* This game needs optimisation. I have a pretty good rig that is new. This game pushed it still. Graphically the game is gorgeous minus some of the bad facial animations and lots of glitching through items like clothes on the NPC's here and there. Otherwise beautiful for the most part.  I only crashed once in a 25 hours. So my experience was not bad, janky a bit, but overall a good experience. I know many others have had a more negative experience.* The story is the highlight of this game. Choice and consequences play into it and effect your end experience. One big negative is you CANNOT upload past saves. You only get one save (from you last checkpoint). So if you pick the wrong option in a quest and you want to back track, nope, your out of luck.  I found this out the hard way when I wanted to go back and change a option in a side quest and the option was not there.* You CANNOT respec your points. So put points into your attributes like vigour, agility and power, etc. before you put them into upgrading weapons. Both use the same in game \"currency\" to upgrade called Anima. Until you know your play style and know which weapons you want to max out. Each weapon can go up to level 5. Each attribute to level 20.* The combat feels good most of the time. It can be janky due to fps dips. You will have to fiddle around with your graphic settings, and in the menu it does allow quite a bit of flexibility to do this.The game has many side quests and some tie into the main quest at the end. The game will tell you verbally that going beyond certain points in the main quest line will block you out of certain progression in side missions. And before the final quest area in Versailles it will tell you that any unfinished quests will not be accessible beyond said point. That I appreciated since you cannot go back and load up past saves.Is this game worth it. I am more middle ground. I would say get it on sale and research before buying it. I gave it my initial two hours and loved the story and visuals. I kept playing it addicted to the story line. I wanted to see how it played out and I love the main character Aegis. I enjoyed my 25 hours despite the flaws. But you need to determine what it is you  want out of the experience and if it is for you.For those of you who are playing...savourer!  ⚔️, Posted: 8 SeptemberThis is the worst optimized game that I ever played. Stay far from this on PC till they fix the performance., Posted: 12 September\"Society seemed to be in a state of complete chaos, and honest people were left to fend for themselves, for the National Guard was made up of a strange crew, a mixture of bizarre and even frightening types. Everyone seemed to be suffering from fear; I grieved for the pregnant women who passed; the faces of most of them were sallow with worry. I noticed besides that the generation born during the Revolution  was, in general, a lot less healthy than the previous one; indeed most of the children born in this sad time were weak and suffering!\"- Mme. Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun's letter to the Princess Natalia Kurakina (Souvenirs De Madame Vigée Le Brun)Preface:Steelrising is an action-adventure game with light RPG elements and plenty of platforming where you play as an automaton in an alternative timeline where robots existed during the French revolution. To this end, the game possesses one of the most unique backdrops possible.Pros:Interesting setting.Satisfying combat.Great weapon variety.Great non-linear level design with plenty of verticality and platforming.Enemies can hit eachother, surprisingly rare in action games.Cons:Bad performance.Janky gameplay.Camera that gets in the way, all to often, of enjoying the game’s world and scenery.Invisible walls here and there.Gameplay – Combat – Character – side questsAs stated above, the player controls a unique automat; known as the Aegis, a beautiful dancer that was presented as a gift to Marie Antoinette, queen of France, to serve both as a page and a guard. This automat is not a fixed protagonist and can be slightly customized with a very barebones character creator in the beginning of the game where you can customize the Aegis’ face, hair and frame materials.The levels are dotted with checkpoints called ‘Vestals’ where automats can undergo repairs and upgrades. Each time the player rests here, all enemies respawn.The character possesses many standard attributes in RPG games, including stamina – which is contextualised in a peculiar manner to the automat; her gears overheat if she moves too much in a short span of time, herein another unique mechanic is introduced, one similar to the Ki pulse from Nioh; if the Automat runs out of stamina, the gears will overheat and lock out for a short period of time, then, the player can press a prompt to freeze the Automat’s gears, restoring a portion of the Automat’s stamina; the faster your reaction the more is restored, but the caveat is that if you press it too early the Automat’s gears will remain debilitated for longer. The most beautiful thing about this intriguing mechanic is that the player doesn’t need to look at the UI or any prompt at all to handle it; the gears themselves are a visual indicator of when to force them to freeze. Another caveat to this mechanic is that each time the player activates this ability, they will apply a frozen status to the automat, which makes her susceptible to becoming frozen (vulnerable to attack).There are many weapons in the game, each having unique style of gameplay. Some weapons are ranged (which feel like secondary weapons intended to provide support to your melee weapon). The Aegis can equip 2 weapons, and use only 1 at a time. Each weapon has a unique ability (parry, block, sword dance, etc).The game has some small errands (it’s really hard to call them side quests) scattered thereabouts in each level. They’re comically bad to the point I agreed to myself that one of them is perhaps the worst quest I ever had the displeasure of playing through; so to speak, in one of the earlier levels, a woman would call out from inside her shabby home, in her thick British accent, sparing no breath in complaining about the lack of water; the player can talk to her, and she’ll repeat her pleas for water. A “water flask” is conveniently placed nearby (a sprint 5 or so seconds for the Aegis). Upon giving the denizen this flask of water, she’ll thank you and give you 5 petrification grenades. It is worth mentioning, these NPC’s are very similar to Bloodborne’s NPC’s, whom you’d talk to from their doors, and they’d never show you their faces – you can only hear their voices. There’s many such NPC’s in Steelrising’s France, where a nationwide curfew has been ordered by Louis XVI, and the automats roam the streets having recently suppressed dissidents. In a sense, it is similar to the Night of the Hunt in Bloodborne. To this end, I believe this game is more like Bloodborne than ‘Dark Souls’.What sets this game apart?As stated above, this game makes a blend of mechanics found in Nioh with mechanics found in ‘Dark Souls’. Instead of the monotony of waiting for your energy to replenish (in this case, for the automat’s gears to cool down), you can remain directly engaged by replenishing your energy and immediately re-entering the fray. This mechanic succeeds in novelising, as it did so well in Nioh, the combat by largely obliterating those periods of inertia where the player waits for the character to catch their breath and recover some stamina to resume fighting. Given a skilled disposition in fighting her enemies, the Automat can remain in the fight all the time.In addition to this, the game possesses a real narrative and story. With plenty of characters and readable material. This includes a codex with entries for characters and world events.French History – Period – Intrigue – CharactersIf you are an avid reader of French history, this game is one of the most interesting prospects you could invest your time with. Being a person who is often had bones to pick with irresponsible handling and anachronisms in modern media in regards to history (which admittedly this game suffers from in several aspects) I found this game to be relieving; the setting isn’t just an afterthought. It isn’t “let’s do bloodborne with.. uhh… French revolution aesthetics” (then proceeds to do a hodgepodge of “aesthetics” spanning several centuries). It’s a game that has the hallmarks of being made by people interested in this historical period, and this interest is informing the game – the game being an extension of this passion, not the other way around. I knew this, the second the first cutscene panned to a framed scan of Mme. Elisabeth Vigee le Brun’s famous “Marie-Antoinette et ses enfants” hanging on the wall. The game did not stop indulging these sensibilities there – it kept introducing many significant figures from the period, starting with the famous scientist Lavoisier – contextualized in the game as someone who helped develop mechanical oils for the automats – and the Marquise de Lafayette, the man who attempted to course the revolution into moderate straits, in a role contextually similar to his real one as well, and even the Painter David receives a reference in the game. What I greatly disliked however, was how the game’s narrative paints the monarch Louis XVI as being an evil tyrant who has built armies of automats to impose himself on the French; a monarch who in reality was so harmless it cost him and many of his family their lives.Performance – Glitches – Technical issuesUnfortunately, the writing was on the wall for this game before it even released, and herein lies its single worst aspect; its terrible performance. This issue has been dismissed by some before the release during the beta, but as we stand today playing the supposed full version – it seems only slightly better, and even high end machines such as mine (R5 3600x, RTX 3080, 16gb RAM) struggle to run this game. To this end, I had wished that the developers delayed this game, seeing its state in the to make due salvaging for the technicalities of this game.Verdict;Gfx: 7.5/10OST: 7/10Story: 8/10Gameplay: 7.5/10Performance: 4/10Overall feeling (not an aggregate of the previous ratings); 7.5/10., Posted: 10 SeptemberA few opening thoughts before I get to the review :- I've not experienced any performance problems noted in other reviews. However, im running the game on medium with a beefy system (RTX 3070, 64gb ram, and a nice beefy ryzen CPU). I've not bothered putting the game on higher graphics because it doesnt look like it's super worth it.- I have a pretty high tolerance for jank in my games- I have a pretty low tolerance for bad design decisionsOn to the review :Spiders makes a souls-like, and it's .. pretty much on par with what you'd expect from a souls-like made by spiders. If you aren't familiar, spiders is a \"double A\" development studio that's made some very hit-or-miss games. Its most recent entry was Greedfall which (surprisingly maybe ?) seems placed in a very similar era and style. Where Greedfall promised a \"mass-effect\"-like experience, this one is hopping on to the \"git gud\" soulslike train, and just like Greedfall it .. sorta works. Your mileage may vary.The atmosphere, music and visual presentation is honestly on point, it's original and bold enough to actually be compelling. The narrative is alright, servicable if anything, but so far it's nothing to write home about.Where I think things start to get \"spiders\"-y is the combat -- it's stiff, really stiff. This is \"by design\" (depending on whether you believe the studio's explanation to be completely true, half true, or a lie is up to you) and meant to emulate fighting as a big ol' clunky set of gears of and whirring bits and bobs. Some weapons do feel noticably more fluid -- namely the fans and claws -- while some others feel almost unusable because of the animation commitment every single move requires from you -- namely any heavy weapon. Where things get a little out of my comfort zone however is the difficulty in understanding how enemies will react to certain attacks, and how you'll react to theirs. Much like souls-like games you've got some \"poise\" score that will determine if getting slapped will knock you straight on your robot arse, or if you're just going to trade blows and watch a chunk of your health get nipped out. For the player, this is super consistent and easy to figure out -- for enemies however, that stagger seems to be on an invisible bar (similar to the \"posture\" bar that medium weapons excel at breaking for a finisher, but not to be confused with it) that rises and falls based on the \"impact\" score of your weapon. This inconsistency is a little irksome as you need to do some mental math in order to know if its worth pressing the attack or if you need to back away for a second to avoid trading health. It isn't a dealbreaker, but these are the little details that may be dealbreakers for some.The last bit I want to touch on is the element mechanic; You get fire for damage over time, lightning for added damage per hit, or frost for (and wait for it) a complete stun for a few seconds on any enemy (including bosses!). This.. is pretty insanely unbalanced -- stacking frost on any build trivializes a big portion of the game until you find some frost resistant enemies, but then fire will be just as devastating. Your ability to abuse these boils down to whether you want to spend a few extra minutes farming for resources to just stock up on grenades, or little alchemial solutions to use your special abilities. I have a hard time justifying this completely skewed balance. But it's part of the \"spiders\" charm -- just like guns in Greedfall being absolutely overpowered, its just how it is.Overall, Steelrising is FINE, its competent, it does what it says on the tin -- here's a souls-like game with some cool twists made by a studio that's tiny. If that's your thing, great -- its not a bad romp. But for a double-A game with a triple-A pricetag, you may want to wait for a slight discount if you're on the fence., Posted: 8 SeptemberI'm loving this game.Not the hardest game, but not the easiest game.From the menu music to the in-game audio and play style.Well done!!!If you have an NVIdia card. go to advanced Video settings and set your upscaling mode to NVidia DLSS, I then use Balanced mode - this makes the game extremely smooth for meyou can also turn on ray tracing., Posted: 11 SeptemberI love everything about the game but the performance is really not where its supposed to be, I know Spiders can do better than this and I truly hope they don't run away from the project and instead keep improving the game and the performance.From DSO Gaming performance analysishttps://www.dsogaming.com/pc-performance-analyses/steelrising-pc-performance-analysis/\"At 1080p/Ultra/No Ray Tracing, there wasn’t any GPU that could offer a constant 60fps experience. Yes, both our NVIDIA RTX3080 and AMD Radeon RX 6900XT had drops below 60fps.\"\"And, as we’ve already reported, the game’s Ultra Textures require more than 13GB at 1080p. (and they can see no reason for it and that's not saying that the game looks bad, its beautiful imo), Posted: 9 SeptemberI've never left a negative review on a game before, and I don't want to leave one here, but I honestly feel like it's needed. I didn't wanna believe the reviews but this game is so poorly optimized and I'm saying that after meeting more than the minimum requirements. Also on that note, if you want to make a game available to the masses, then the minimum specs for graphics definitely should not be RTX 2060. That said, the ultra graphics of Steelrising doesn't look that good for the performance requirements, and there are other games with absolutely insane graphics and much lower requirements (needed to run them on Ultra graphics), so the minimum requirements of RTX 2060 and recommended reqs of RTX 2070 SUPER or RTX 3060 Ti makes no sense and in fact just shows a major lack of optimization. If the game was still in alpha this would be fine but releasing a game in this condition and selling it for this price is just insane. I'm sure people would have understood if the game was delayed in order for it to be optimized. Hope this game can end up improving similar to how No Man's Sky did as I really think it could work if it was greatly optimized, and if the control response as well as the lack of movement were improved.]</td>\n",

changed my lifeI love my tromboner, Posted: 15 SeptemberGiving my wife nightmares playing this next to her in bed on the steamdeck.  10/10, Posted: 15 Septemberthis is the best game i have ever played hatsune miku should collab, Posted: 15 SeptemberMove aside Elden Ring... GOTY right here, Posted: 15 SeptemberAbsolute Amazing, stunning game play. I feel as miserable as I do when I play a real trombone.I cant believe I can finally call myself a true tromboner. Thank you, thank you so much.I've lost feeling in my fingers., Posted: 15 SeptemberIt is the perfect game. I will be upset if Trombone Champ does not win game of the year 2022., Posted: 15 SeptemberIt's exaclty what i asked for and its the most beautiful thing i've ever seen, Posted: 15 SeptemberI am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and trombone and started playing but I was stuck on how to hit the correct notes. I asked my Son for help and he did. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories., Posted: 16 SeptemberAs a trumpet player, I can say that this is 100% accurate to how a trombone would sound if I played it. I appreciated the 100%, totally accurate trombone facts.All jokes aside, this game is great and unique. I deeply appreciate the amount of effort that went into the game. It's accurate (as much as a rhythm game can be for an instrument like trombone) and it also embodies the type of humor I've found trombone/low brass players to have., Posted: 16 SeptemberGreat game, would be cool to have a onlie gammode to duet with friends and stuff.]  \n",

SeptemberIf you're a fan of Hololive, this is a pretty safe buy. I don't know if they're planning on adding further content to this game, but if not, I would say the price is probably more like $5 worthy than $10. This is only a 3 hour experience, and thats ifyou go after the other endings. The animations and art are relatively nice. I came across a bug where I fell through the floor at one point, and had to restart, but it's not that big of a setback thanks to the chapter select. Even though I play on a high-end PC, the levels,the shrine in particularlag pretty badly for about 10 to 20 seconds at the beginning of the level. That's nitpicky though, overall this is a fun experience for Hololive fans and I recommend it. If you aren't a Hololive fan and was just interested in the horror aspect, you can probably skip this., Posted: 15 SeptemberPlease buy this game and help fund HoloEarth, Posted: 15 SeptemberSuisex., Posted: 15 SeptemberBetter than buying a monkey., Posted: 15 SeptemberI like the part where I was walking toward woman that was scariest part. (I can't interact with them), Posted: 15 Septemberman, I love Kanashe's definitely an angel 😇, Posted: 16 Septemberdo not let this video game distract you from the fact that pekora bought a monkey, Posted: 16 SeptemberIt's good and it's hololive. And also, Glasses are really versatile. First, you can have glasses-wearing girls take them off and suddenly become beautiful, or have girls wearing glasses flashing those cute grins, or have girls stealing the protagonist's glasses and putting them on like, \"Haha, got your glasses!\" That's just way too cute! Also, boys with glasses! I really like when their glasses have that suspicious looking gleam, and it's amazing how it can look really cool or just be a joke. I really like how it can fulfill all those abstract needs. Being able to switch up the styles and colors of glasses based on your mood is a lot of fun too! It's actually so much fun! You have those half rim glasses, or the thick frame glasses, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a buffet. I really want Luna to try some on or Marine to try some on to replace her eyepatch. We really need glasses to become a thing in hololive and start selling them for HoloComi. Don't. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Give. Everyone. Glasses?]  \n",

                                      [Posted: 15 SeptemberAbout an hour in already and I really love it.What I liked - I love the character builder system so far. Lots of choices. Quite a bit of learning by using which works great for me, I enjoy that exploration of it. Optional missions that are replayable and with some secrets to find is also quite fun.Monsters already have seemed varied and different. I enjoy that it's not all just a different color and call it good.I was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed the art style.The game feels like the true tactics games, with fun RPG elements in how you set up your characters. If you really like tactics games, you don't really need to read any longer, it's worth the cost.Concerns - There are a few UI aspects I wish they'd adjust, and the speed you scroll on the map you may want to change to the slowest possible as it's quite fast on any other setting. Took a little bit to get used to, but once I got things where I wanted them it was fine.The Meh - The story so far seems pretty cut and dry. You are effectively to weak to fight the big bad while they do some terrible stuff. But they let you live so you can get stronger and defeat them. (Guessing). However! This is an early thought and not only could there be a twist I haven't seen. Also, really it doesn't bother me., Posted: 15 SeptemberThe first tactics game I ever played was Final Fantasy tactics. Have always been a big fan of the genre. Absolute Tactics *absolutely* does the genre justice ;D. Would definitely recommend if you're a tactics fan and looking for something with a fun story line and accessible mechanics. Well done!, Posted: 15 SeptemberBought it day 1 and played for an hour. The game runs alright on the steam deck. No issue booting it up and the controls work just fine.The game in itself seems alright so far. Nothing too crazy either. The plot feels like it's going to be cliché as hell and the gameplay in itself is nothing more nor less than you'd expect from the genre. I'm a bit confused about the class leveling system though and I wish the menu you get in between main story missions were a bit more than \"just a menu\". No world map, just a couple stores, a sidequest list and your roster and that's it. I think any character can equip any sort of equipment as well, which is a bummer. I'd have liked see a bit more diversity in what and who could equip different sorts of equipment, but hey.I guess it'll scratch the itch for a dozen hours, but I would wait to get it on sale with a 50% discount at least. Not worth it at full price., Posted: 15 SeptemberMy first impressions are largely positive.In terms of combat, there doesn't seem to be the level of complexity seen in Final Fantasy Tactics or Fell Seal. That said, what's there is pretty good. Each of the main characters has a unique attack pattern and a few unique attacks. Outside of that, classes come in the form of manuals which each character can equip two of. These provide both stat bonuses and additional skills. Enemies tend to be vulnerable to skills or basic attacks, which can end up heavily influencing positioning. Certainly a nice wrinkle. In terms of skills, you have your standard array of ranged attacks, aoes, buffs, debuffs, etc. The buffs and debuffs  I've encountered so far are impactful. I've only played a few maps so far, but there seems to be a focus on having a variety of scenarios. For instance, one mission had 3 phases: an initial \"stealth\" phase, a large castle fight, and finally an escape in a carriage.I'm enjoying the art quite a bit. It's certainly a step up over many other indie strategy games, and has it's own charm.The writing so far has been fine. I saw another review say that it was bad middle school fan fiction level, which is way overblown. A lot of the characters have a fairly strong anime trope feel to them. The main character is a head strong hero who won't listen when someone says to stay back. One of the main antagonists is a petulant young witch/demon/not sure yet and comes across a bit strong. I'm sure this somewhat tropey style will come across negatively to many, but I don't mind it. While the main story is coming across as fairly standard fair to this point, I'm still enjoying myself. I doubt there will be anything ground breaking, but that's fine. There's a nice bit of a tongue in cheek humor to it that's had me grinning fairly often.I'll update the review if my opinion changes as I go further, but I wanted to go ahead and give some first impressions for potential buyers., Posted: 15 SeptemberProduct received for freeTo give this game a fair review, keep in mind that this game was developed by a gargantuesque team of two people.The game is promising.From hanging on the game's official forums, the developers show interest in making additional content for the game and I think there lies the issue: the game doesn't need additional content, but a better user experience.The game feels like a cask beer. A treat for the amateur, but a failure for the uninitiated.For the fans of the genre, the maps are elegantly furnished and decorated and well thought out. The art style is beautiful.Overall, the game offers you a good turn-based tactical RPG experience with a cliché story to tie it up.The story telling and world building is awkward, but functional. There is a nice unit customisation feature in the otherwise dry inter-mission menu., Posted: 15 SeptemberProduct received for freeThe best way that I can describe this game is essentially as one step up from those RPG Maker games. The character portraits, the animations and most importantly, the writing for this game are all akin to that you would find in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fanfiction of god knows what. This game is bad.Before anyone has a heart attack as they always do when I haven't 100% a game 3 times in the span of 24 hours before I review it, I played to the first big boss of the game and will not be finishing it. I do not like this game, and I played a good bit past the point of refunding being possible without having fun. That alone is enough to leave a review, but I'm going to detail some of my issues with this game both for the prospective buyers and for the devs if they happen to see this. I'm not trying to be insulting when I talk about Absolute Tactics, but this game really is not good and especially since they are charging 25 bucks for it? No way in hell I'm giving them a pass here, even if I didn't have to pay for it, anyone else that wants this game will have to and thats a crime.First and foremost, lets talk gameplay. This is modeled after games like FF Tactics and Fire Emblem (a stretch on the second one), and yet it does nothing to shake up the genre. I will say, I did not in fact get to the \"war\" stages they advertise as their unique inclusion to the genre with tons of units on screen at once, but with the way they handled combat in the early stages, I imagine there isn't much nuance to those fights beyond there being a lot of units on screen at once. The level design, which is one of the most important aspects of a tactics game, is quite bad.While the levels actually look decent, they never do anything interesting to limit or push your combat capabilities. If you have a 2 square attack the enemy is 2 squares away, even if they are on a massive incline where your attack shouldn't reach, your attack will hit. You can shoot through things and hit over things, which isn't a problem inherently, but ANY attack can hit ANYwhere as long as it is in range, and even with the base squad of characters, every single one of my characters had something that could hit over or behind obstacles by the time I hit the first big boss. You might see this as a positive, but it makes the game far too easy, which brings me to my next point.There is no urgency whatsoever in this game in the absolute worst way. There is no turn limit, there is no time limit, there is nothing to push you into the enemies. You can move one block at a time if you want and the enemies won't come to you until you cross certain thresholds in the level which are invisible, but very easy to decipher. I didn't want something to attack me at one point so I brought my frontline up to the edge of where I thought their aggro range was and then had my 2 fast characters running around in the area I had cleared already getting all the collectibles and items. It took 6 turns of them running around, and THEN I advanced.There is also a really annoying obsession the game seems to have with making you do turn based movement all the time. There was one point where there was a fight 3 turns worth of walking away. Instead of just having a cutscene, they made me walk my way up to the fight and interjected dialogue in between each turn, it was obnoxious, and this happens a lot.This brings me to my final point, and honestly the worst part of this game. Even while a tactics game that isn't very tactically deep is a sin, the story of this game that forces you to engage with the story at every turn? I cannot stress this enough, this is middle school fanfiction levels of writing.There was maybe 2 or 3 lines I chuckled at, and the rest of it was just word vomit trying to seem like some grand adventure. Its like those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ isekai anime but without the fanservice and fun fights to save it. This game takes its story as though you will be totally invested, and does nothing to actually invest you in it. There were typos, and it was predictable enough that 20 minutes in I could tell you the entirety of the plot without skipping a beat. The characters are awful, the dialogue is worse, and there is nothing redeeming about the story here. While I absolutely have stories in games that are awful but the game remains good (Neon White comes to mind, cringe dialogue, dope game) this game is interwoven with the story much to its detriment. You can't escape it, you can't skip it.There are some good points to this game, and it is entirely possible that there are some big twists in gameplay and the story that turn this game around, but almost 3 hours in and it did nothing to impress me. The music is fine and the voice acting is decent, but there is only one voice acted character in the entire game, and beyond that... I struggle to find much else redeeming. This entire game is an exercise in tedium, and forgets to do the one thing that games are supposed to do. It forgets to be fun.If you made it this far I'd appreciate you following my steam curator page. I review lots of games indie and not with consumers in mind. Normally I put in a good bit more time into a game before I review it, but this is just a hobby for me so if something really is just not doing it for me (like this game) I just play up to the 2 hour mark or a good stopping point so I can give enough information for prospective buyers. I have a few more games like this one (but better hopefully) lined up to review so follow along for that, thanks for reading.Check out my steam curator page for more reviews on (mostly) indie games:https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42143664/, Posted: 15 SeptemberI’ve been looking forward to this game for awhile because I love SRPGs and graphics that look like high quality hand-drawn animation like Arc Systems Works games, for example. Absolute Tactics doesn’t disappoint and is a worthy successor to classics like Fire Emblem, Vandal Hearts, Shining Force and Final Fantasy Tactics. It’s able to take the best from these famous games that probably inspired it while adding plenty of unique and interesting features of its own. Between its stunning visuals, great gameplay and fun dialogue, this is a game that’s not to be missed. Considering this is the first title from Curious Fate, their future looks bright, indeed!, Posted: 15 SeptemberWas really hyped about this game. In the 20 minutes I played I found issues with my controller, it changed my display resolution, it really disappointed me with the quality of the animations and it softlocked me in the menu that I opened to see if the \"Keyboard and Mouse\" had some keybinds because it seemed like it was only using my mouse which was terrible to play with.Can't recommend the game in its current state but I really hope they fix this issues., Posted: 15 SeptemberProduct received for freeFull Gameplay Walkthrough -https://youtu.be/F_GEg4SndG0One of the very Best Turn Based Strategy Games of 2022, everything is top-notch about this game, from aesthetics to the plot.You also have an extra free slot for a class where you can add a class of your liking so max 2 classes for each character, you can experiment around to make your builds.The Plot is unique and exciting and it makes you ask several questions throughout the journey, pushing you to play the game even more.A large variety of monsters and unique attack skills with different characteristicsThere is also a shop after each mission where you can upgrade your characters - you can buy better weapons armour , skills, etc0 Bugs or glitches so far and it's very well optimized.Overall Its a great game and you should definitely play this !!Score - 9/10 ( Go for it ), Posted: 15 SeptemberGreat music, fantastic visuals]  \n",

Kongregate and then on my phone. Lost progress from kongregate to phone which was fine. But now I have to restart AGAIN to get idleon rewards? Not a fan of that. I will because I want the items but that's about it.Very predatory gem shop in this one. If you thought idleon was bad, just wait till you see this., Posted: 15 SeptemberDont usually rate games, but Ive been playing since Kongregate days. Love this game glad its finally on steam!, Posted: 15 SeptemberThis is the best idle game to exist. The most content. Still content unlocked almost a year after playing the game on mobile. Secrets. Idle fun., Posted: 15 SeptemberDo you wanna play runescape to watch the gains? Do you want to commit 10 hours a day to get anywhere in it within the next decade of needed playing? NO!? Well idle numbers go brrrrrrrrr will please you., Posted: 16 Septembermonetized like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile game, utter lack of QoL (other than the QoL they hold hostage behind a paywall), ridiculous number formarts. I played the game years ago on kong and thought to see if it improved any with the steam release. Of course it hasn't., Posted: 15 Septemberfeels like idleon but more idle, good., Posted: 15 SeptemberIt’s pretty great but it’s missing sex, Posted: 16 SeptemberTLDR: Bang for buck, this is the game.I've played through this game multiple times on the phone version (years of playtime), and I'm excited to finally get the chance to play it on PC too. With that said, I feel like I have enough experience with this and similar games to give this one a resounding endorsement.If you enjoy incremental progress games, this is probably one of the best you'll find out there. While idling is definitely a possibility, one of the biggest reasons I've kept playing for so long is because the game really lets you play to the activity level you want. If you want to play actively all day, the game really will let you play actively. If you want to check in and then quit out to let idle time accumulate, you'll progress that way too. Being able to take things at your own speed depending on mood and availability makes this a great game to keep around.Another big selling point for this game is depth. This game has been through updates and expansions for years, and the game systems have a way of evolving and deepening the further along you get. Systems gradually unlock more and more content, and various challenges that you take at your own pace provide interconnection between different branches of the game.Most importantly: The game is designed with the intent that you can play through and beat everything without spending a single dollar. The first time I bottomed out and maxed everything, I didn't spend a single cent. There are in game mechanics and minigames that award a steady stream of gems, more than enough to get any powerups necessary to reach end game content. It's a single player game. Spend as much as you want or nothing. Anyone complaining that it's pay to win: yes, you can drop crazy money on gems if you want, nothing stopping you. But if you need that kind of speed then why even play an incremental game?It costs nothing to try, so try it here or maybe pick it up for mobile and give it a once over next time you're dumping out., Posted: 16 SeptemberOnly playing it because it gives rewards for a different game, Posted: 16 Septemberhow to open auto?]  \n",

are a delight. The art is stunning - each new card is a joy to behold, the portraits all exude charisma. And the writing got a few good chuckles out of me. I was a bit worried about how complex the gameplay might be, but it gets very intuitive once you make it past the tutorial phase. It plays very smoothly - the kind of game that makes you want to cancel your week-end plans :), Posted: 15 SeptemberThis one goes straight in my top favorite card games. The narrative aspect is perfect, like the dialogues and the narrator, not too much, just the perfect amount. The clever way of combinning the skills and item cards with map cards and/or event cards. There are some REALLY fun combination to be made! The fact that you can literally try to be a hero or a \"villain\" so to speak, by killing everyone in your path or stealing everything, it's just so much fun. The music and ambiences are great and fit perfectly. I really dig the visuals, not only the cards but the different types of background for each part of a mission and the change of mood... Man, it's just... Perfect!Clearly you guys put a lot of effort into this game., Posted: 15 SeptemberIf you are looking for a \"slay the spire\" combat card game, this is not that game.This game is a resource management / choose your own adventure / choices matter  story driven card game.You will be choosing different story scenarios and trying to make the best out of a bad situation.PROSGreat art, writing, musicCharming charactersVery polished game (no bugs, good ui. etc)Choices matter A LOT (scenarios you choose, objectives you complete, who you save, who you kill, etc)Many characters with different functions, abilities, and strengthsCONSSome puzzles could be better explained but this is solved by pressing the \"light bulb\" multiple times for different hintsCombat is basic and almost non-existent as it's almost always better to mercy / intimidate / resource the enemy awayFor the price, this game is well worth the play through., Posted: 15 SeptemberGreat game.  Kept me up too late.  Bedtime for Bonzo.  But, again, great game., Posted: 16 SeptemberJust played for an hour before going to work and felt compelled to drop by to say how much I love this game. It's super hard to summarize what it actually is: a card game, but also a storytelling machine, but also a strategy game, but also a CYOA... Anyways, it's fresh, it's unique and it's highly recommended!, Posted: 15 SeptemberI usually return card based games because I get tired of their mechanics. But I try them. This one I won't return - it is great!This game gives the player interesting ways to explore and play using the cards. And it gives the player lots of choices. It feels like a choose your adventure RPG with excellent writing and art.There is really not a thing I can complain about here. If there was one thing it would be that I wish I could save the game when I want to. It auto-saves after you complete a region which usually takes between 15 to 30 minutes.

Serj Tankian and Matt Heafy I buy without a second thought 💀, Posted: 15 SeptemberIt's fun. Just in case the demo didn't make that obvious enough., Posted: 15 September”Hell is Hell, and down there, they take away what you love most. They took her voice. For now, what you need to know is: she wanted it back.”Gameplay video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhuAZwxORMcMetal: Hellsingeris a rhythm first-person shooter where you fire, reload, slaughter and dodge on the beat. The original soundtrack contains some of the best metal music that you’ll ever hear, made by the very best metal musicians out there. I wanted to play this game ever since it was revealed more than 2 years ago at E3, and it definitely delivered.Pros✔️ Fast and addictive rhythm-based combat, with smooth movement and gunplay✔️ Fantastic soundtrack; Metal is love. Metal is life.✔️ Amazing visuals.✔️ Lots of replay value.✔️ Butter-smooth 60 FPS.Cons❌ The story/narrative is nothing special; not great, not terrible.❌ Bland boss design, the same boss can be seen in 7 different levels.StoryYou play as The Unknown, a half-demon half-human that was imprisoned by the Red Judge, the ruler of hell and the one that stole her voice. You return to hell to slay enemies (demonic and angelic), kill the Red Judge and reclaim your voice back, with the help of a talking skull, as well as the cutscene narrator and weapon used in the game, called Paz. That’s the story for you in a nutshell, not the best out there, but it helps keep the players engaged. You can find more about the story and lore in the Codex.GameplayYou have to sync your shots, quick reloads (pressing the reload button as soon as the yellow beat goes inside the reticle) and dashes to the beat of the music, and the rhythm detection reticle, which serves as a guide to help you match your actions. The game calls it “Beat Matching”. It sounds hard but it becomes pretty easy once you get the hang of it. When an enemy is severely wounded, you can perform a slaughter (on beat as the rest), which is similar to DOOM's glory kills, and you can regain some health from it.The game has a Fury multiplier, and it moves up and down depending on your beat matching; the more in sync you are with the rhythm, the more intense the music will become, which will, in turn, increase the multiplier (from 1x to 16x maximum) as well as the score. However, going off beat or taking damage will disrupt the multiplier and decrease it.The final score at the end of every level is compiled from slaying demons, destroying objects, damage you’ve taken, total headshots, multi-kills, hit streak (total on beat hits without going off beat), time spent on the level, time spent at 16x fury and kills on the beat. You can still kill enemies and do any action without being in sync, but you won’t get a lot of points from it.There’s a diverse range of challenging enemies, such as gun-wielding demons (sometimes carrying a shield too), fast stalkers that can teleport to your location, strong behemoths that can remove half of your health if you aren’t careful, and Seraphs that can beam you from afar. You will constantly get outnumbered, so keep moving, shooting, and dashing.There are a total of 6 weapons in the game. Two permanent weapons that you'll always have in your arsenal are the sword and Paz, a headbanging skull that shoots fireballs, and it is the least powerful weapon, but you can still use it (shoot on beat) to keep your fury up even when enemies aren’t around. You will be able to carry two of the four remaining weapons that you’ll unlock in the first 4 levels; a pump-action shotgun, a dual pistol, a crossbow that fires explosive bolts, and dual boomerang-style blades. Each weapon has a powerful ultimate attack that can be charged up by performing successful-on-beat hits.After completing a level, three new challenges (also known as Torments) open up, and each challenge will reward you with a new sigil, or an upgrade to an existing one. There are a total of 7 sigils that give you an extra buff, help you increase your score, or save you from anything that can interrupt your hit streak/multiplier. You can equip two sigils in a level. Those challenges are completely optional and you don’t have to play them to beat the game, but those sigils are useful if you are thinking of getting your name at the top of the leaderboards.Aside from the tutorial, there are 8 levels of Hell where each one ends with a boss, and first 7 features the Judge’s Aspect, and they look the same but with very slight design changes and a different ability or two after every level. They were fun, but the design of the final boss looked mediocre, but the fight was an adrenaline rush, and it featured the best song in the game.SoundtrackThe soundtrack is awesome, definitely a 10/10 in my book. It features multiple metal bands and singers, such as Matt Heafy (Trivium), Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy), Randy Blythe (Lamb of God), Tatiana Shmayluk (Jinjer), and many others.  The music starts off light once you begin a level, keep slaying enemies on the beat and it will get more intense. They’ve done a fantastic job of blending music and FPS elements, making it feel like the weapons are instruments and part of the song.Graphics & Level DesignThe game looks great. Thankfully, you don’t need a heavy graphics card to play the game, even on high settings. There are 8 Hells (levels) and they look somewhat similar, but with different skyboxes or weather. They are very linear so there is no point in exploring, and each one takes about 10-15 minute to complete, depending on how fast you can kill.TechnicalMy PC:RTX 3070, Intel I9-10850k, 32 GB RAM, Windows 10 Home, 1080pThe game ran great, with butter-smooth 60 FPS. no bugs to report.Additional Details:Total playtime8.5 hoursMBK or ControllerMBK, definitelyOffline modeYesSteam Deck40 FPS at the lowest settingsGames SavesNoneFinal ThoughtsThe game has 8 levels, aside from the tutorial, and it took me 5 hours to complete all levels and their challenges. This is another fantastic rhythm FPS game with fun combat, a fantastic soundtrack and great visuals. Having said that, the boss design is bland and the story is mediocre. In addition to the custom music modding support that they’ll be adding later, I hope they’ll release more levels in the future, and new songs to jam on to while slaying demons.for more quality reviews like this, follow our curator page,Summit Reviews., Posted: 15 SeptemberI can't believe this amazing metal album comes with a free game!, Posted: 15 SeptemberFull gameplay on beast mode on my youtube channel: TheBaldMan:https://www.youtube.com/c/TheBaldMan~ DIFFICULTY ~🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it🔲 Easy🔲 Normal☑️ Hard🔲 Dark Souls~ GRAPHICS ~🔲 MS Paint🔲 Bad🔲 Meh🔲 Graphics dont matter in this game🔲Good☑️ Beautiful🔲 Masterpiece~ MUSIC ~🔲 Bad🔲 Not special🔲 Good☑️ Beautiful~ STORY ~🔲 This game has no story🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story☑️ It's there for the people who want it🔲 Well written🔲 Epic story~ PRICE ~🔲 Free🔲 Underpriced☑️ Perfect Price🔲 Could be cheaper🔲 Overpriced🔲 Complete waste of money~ REQUIREMENTS ~🔲 You can run it on a microwave🔲 Average☑️High end🔲 NASA computer~ LENGTH ~🔲 Very Short (0 - 3 hours)☑️ Short (3 - 15 hours)🔲 Average (15-50 hours)🔲 Long (50-90 hours)🔲 Extremely long (90-110 hours)🔲 No ending~ FUN ~🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry🔲 Hard to enjoy🔲 Repetitive☑️ Actually pretty amusing🔲 Ride of your life~ REPLAYABILITY~🔲 It's a one-time experience☑️ Only for achievements🔲 If you wait a few months/years🔲Definitely🔲Infinitely replayable~ WORTH BUYING ~🔲 No🔲 Wait for sale☑️ Yes, Posted: 15 SeptemberAnother great FPS-rhythm game just likeBPM: bullets per minutebut much MUCH better!

Great atmosphere, fun combat, lots of extra content, & total homage to 1980s Italian horror. Definitely a bang for your buck for 6-8 hours of content, Posted: 14 SeptemberHazy night, gory night,Night of infernal flames,Open tombs, desecrated flesh,Maggots, ghouls, zombies in sight.Load up your gun,Aim always for the head,The last thing you want,Is to join the undead.Now shall I grapple with the fiend,This will be my last stand,Wish me well, my friends,I'll be down by the Gates of Hell., Posted: 15 SeptemberYou got guts coming into these woods with cheeks like that(‿ˠ‿), Posted: 14 SeptemberThis game is absolutely mental in the best way possible. Right off the bat it throws you into a world of uncomfortable campy Italian apocalypse giallo and just keeps turning up the spooky meter as the minutes go by. The zombies are frightening and slow. Fulci slow.  There's a bunch of filters that let you zone in on a specific TV era for max immersion. They're really excellent and works the best out of any game (The Quarry, Resident Evil, Dying Light) that offers the option to change visuals. I haven't put much time into it, but i'm excited to feel so existential and depraved of hope from this game when I can give it more. DEFINITELY PICK IT UP!!!, Posted: 15 SeptemberFinally!This is an amazing survival horror game. It's refreshing to play a game where your choices and skill in gameplay actually matters again. Every single bullet counts and that's the way survival horror should be! I've always been the type of guy to save every bullet so this is my kind of game. It totally flies off the rails by the end but I honestly really appreciate the apartment level more than any other. Just you, your guns, your wits, and your problem-solving skills. Hell yeah.The story is somewhat simplistic but I prefer it that way. I'm here to have fun, not compare and contrast themes with H.P. Lovecraft. The graphics are retro and look great! This game takes inspiration from early Italian horror flicks so the environments feel nostalgic in a weird way. If you think the graphics look bad, you're just not into the aesthetic and that's fine.There are two negatives for me.First negative: There was a big bug in the janitor office that caused my game to hang up and have to restart the entire area but I think it's already been fixed and I'm willing to forgive that because I played it the second it came out.Second negative: I think this game would have been a lot more fun if it weren't presented in the format of 'levels'. Basically, there are no save points. If you complete a level, you've unlocked it and can replay it with a set amount of ammo and weapons. This did take away from my overall experience because I'd go from saving a ton of ammo to starting a new level with only a few bullets.Definitely better than Bloodwash and probably my favorite game published by the awesome folks over at Puppet Combo.Thanks for making games!This is my full playthrough / experience with the game:https://youtu.be/nn1VMcMq9YA, Posted: 15 SeptemberProduct received for freeAfter Bloodwash, I couldn't wait to see what Jordan King came out with next! Teaming up again with Henry Hoare, Night At The Gates Of Hell is an absolutely terrifying experience but wonderfully executed to not only show the game's inspiration from Italian horror zombie flicks but also to give the players nostalgia to some of the older zombie games we have played. (Also Booty Creek Cheek Freak being bundled is too good 10/10) I will say this game made it a bit more challenging as you have limited ammo, limited use knives and zombies will only die either with a headshot or being stabbed. It's not impossible to take down the undead (even me with bad aim could get them) so it does let you enjoy a bit of both combat and the storyline without stressing out much. I loved it and as always, I can't wait to see what's next!, Posted: 14 SeptemberProduct received for freeIt's pretty good, kind of made me anxious during the first proper stage at times.However, going through doors is a little finicky where I had to crouch after opening a door to move so keep that in mind while playing if you get stuck., Posted: 15 SeptemberThis is great. Good atmosphere, actually spooky, very cheap, metroidvania elements., Posted: 15 SeptemberThis game was really good! I enjoyed being chased by The Booty Creek Cheek Freak, Posted: 15 SeptemberHilarious game really entertaining, super campy and jank in the best way. Love all the creepy characters and was stoked to see Stan the man return. Booty Creek Cheek Freak made me snort, both extra modes are great, main story is abit longer than other Torture Star/PC titles and was tons of fun. Good bang for your buck imo, was a great way to spend a few hours. More pls 8/10]  \n",

modern plazas. Let your citizens walk freely on pedestrian-only streets while you build brand new city-service buildings and 3 new special districts.🌆Get excited for the brand-new wall-to-wall specialization and a whole collection of new buildings, assets and props to detail your cities. Create, manage and progress your pedestrian areas, small pedestrianized neighbourhoods, park & bus plazas and huge downtown commercial strips just to name a few!Accompanying Plazas & Promenades are two unique Content Creator Packs, 2 Radio Stations & a free update!, How much Ram does the new dlc Plazas and Promenades need? I have 32 gig ram and I am now using 28 ram, computer is still running well the citiy skylines, but what after the new dlc?. I have already 5 earlier dlc., Hello again city-builders! Plazas and Promenades is almost here, and I’m so excited that you will soon be able to enjoy it. As with every major expansion, we have a little something for all players who own the base game, and today’s Dev Diary is all about the free content!Let’s start with a convenient new feature,Quit After Saving, which can be enabled when saving your city. As you may have guessed from the name, it will quit the game once it finishes saving, allowing you to skip the process of saving, waiting for it to finish just to select exit and get a warning about losing progress if you haven’t saved. Very handy when you’re done playing and just need to save and quit the game.Check the box before saving to quit automaticallyNew roadsAs roads are a central part of any city, we are expanding the options even further with 18 new roads. We had a look through the road types you have wished for over the years and added as many of them as we could in this patch. This includes a series of roads with bus-priority lanes, which can be used by other vehicles if they need to turn, and for the first time ever bus-only lanes and roads!In theSmall Roadscategory, you can soon find the new small road with wide sidewalks and small one-way road with wide sidewalks, as well as small roads with a concrete median, grass median, and tree median. For the busier parts of the city, you can grab the small 4-lane road or the 4-lane road with bus lanes, or expand your one-way road system with the 3-lane one-way and 4-lane one-way roads.Stylish and practical selection of new roadsNew in theLarge Roadscategory are the new large roads with medians, featuring 6 lanes in two directions separated by either a concrete median, grass median, or tree-lined median - the latter of which comes in both a regular version and a bus-priority lane version.Expand your busy roads using these new optionsLastly, we have a handful of new Highways for you using the all-new bus-only lanes. Create a high-speed bus network with the two-way bus-only expressway which comes both with or without sound barriers, or integrate bus-only lanes into your existing highways with the highway with bus-only lanes, both with or without sound barriers. And to connect them all you can use the bus-only expressway ramp.Build a bus rapid transit system using the new highwaysWe look forward to seeing how your cities will benefit from these new options and which ones will be your favorites. And while it isn’t a road we do have another network for you, namely the new one-way metro tracks, allowing you more control and customizability over your metro network.Now, all there’s left to do is check out the tutorial video by Overcharged Egg, have a look at the patch notes below, and wait for Plazas and Promenades to release.

Today’s dev diary is all about the new district specializations and new maps, so let’s check them out.First up we have the three newWall-to-wallspecializations that can be used for residential, commercial, and office zones. They unlock at Milestone 6 - Big Town, along with high-density zoning. Each specialization features 48 new modern low-rise buildings to create a unique area in your city. As a new feature to the game, these buildings have murals, which are randomly selected each time a building spawns to create additional variation and color in the neighborhoods.A sprawling wall-to-wall neighborhoodThe new wall-to-wall specializations don’t just look cool, but as a specialization, they also work slightly differently from regular zone types. To reflect their modern construction, these buildings have a lower risk of catching fire, but as they’re built close together, fires spread more easily between them. So make sure to keep a few fire stations nearby just in case they do catch fire.Like previous specializations, they can be found in the Districts and Areas menu under each zone tab and are applied to a district by selecting the specialization and clicking on a district. For pedestrian areas, however, there is no need to create a district, as specializations can be applied directly to the area. If a district and a pedestrian area overlap and have different specializations applied for a specific zone, like commercial, the pedestrian area specialization will be the one used.New mapsNow we can’t have an expansion without new maps for you to build on! For Plazas and Promenades, we have 5 maps for you to choose from, featuring different landscapes and themes.First is the temperate map ofCape Apple. You start centered on a long peninsula with easy access to the surrounding landmasses, creating an excellent environment for a thriving metropolis. Take advantage of the ship connections to bring in tourists or set up a bustling industry along the coast as you build your new city.Cape Apple offers wide open spaces ready to be developedNext, we journey to the tropics withCoastal Gem. It features long wide beaches and lots of open space to build a city on. You can expand inland to reach some of the area's many ore deposits or claim the coastline and benefit from the added land value of waterfront property.Coastal Gem lives up to its name with its beautiful beachesGondola Islandsis the first of our two new European maps. It is made up of a cluster of islands of varying sizes only connected to the mainland by a bridge. Whether you create island communities focused on walkability using pedestrian areas or connect the many islands using the new roads, Gondola Islands will shape any city built here.The island cluster of Gondola Islands have much to offerThe boreal map ofOracle Lakeoffers a large valley filled with forests and lakes for you to build your city on. Base the city’s industry on the large forests, extract the abundant ore in the area, or focus on creating a vibrant tourist destination. The choice is yours.Oracle Lake features many scenic viewsLast but not least is our second European map,Splitz Tributary. Build your city at the foot of the mountains or along the banks of the rivers meeting here. With lots of buildable land, your city can take many forms.Splitz Tributary is an ideal location for a new cityThis concludes our Dev Diaries for the new content coming in Plazas and Promenades. On Tuesday, we’ll have a look at the free update that adds something new for everyone, as well as the patch notes so you’re completely up to date before release. Below Overcharged Egg has another tutorial for you, showing off the new content. Enjoy!, Posted: 12 SeptemberHonestly, I love this game but I'm so tired of Paradox's DLC approach and the lack of updates on a Cities Skylines 2 where we don't have to worry about mods working within the limitations  of an aging game., Posted: 13 Septemberwould be better if they didn't want you to spend over $200 on dlc packs for longevity of the game, Posted: 14 SeptemberLoading issues, I have been wondering if there is really any need to select a style except to apply a certain image or appearance. I mean, does the lack of or use of a style have any technical function? Will the city, a mod or an asset actually be affected in a negative way if a style is is not used?\\n\\nI try to imagine building a rural community when the only style enabled is hi-tech influenced(or vice versa). \\nYippee I-A, ctrl-alt-delete just doesn't seem to work in my brain.\\n\\nI probably shouldn't have brought this up; no..., It broke Node Controller, TMPE, and many other mods\\nDammit, This update that I havent seen has really knackered my game up. Mods clashing. Expected to remove etc etc. Just leave the game as it was, How do these work? i cant get them to deliver goods/collect garbage and they somehow block garbage trucks  from spawning]  \n",

LS's soundtrack is just a masterpiece (just like this whole game), i would like to recommend to watch this composer appreciation video from SnowiestAngeman:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QadtEiz5Ga4, Posted: 14 SeptemberI have played this game for around 200 hours or something on PS5 and I can say that it is my second favorite game of all time behind only Metal Gear Solid 2, which is a bias pick. I think the gameplay, combat, and side content in this game tops all of the other games in the franchise. It improves on everything in the first Judgment, and while there are a few things that can be argued that the first Judgment does better (Side Cases and Friend Mechanic imo,) I still think this game is an all time classic that should be experienced.I made a 36 minute YouTube review if you would like a super in depth and spoiler free look at Lost Judgment and everything it has to offer. If not, then my TL;DR is that this game is a 10/10 masterpiece and I recommend it wholeheartedly.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZAk-0pUIM, Posted: 14 SeptemberMy Judgment was lost.Thanks RGG for bringing this to pc, Posted: 15 Septemberif you aren't sold on the prospect of beating up high schoolers, then you have lost your judgment, Posted: 14 SeptemberRAIL kara hazureta furyouhin no norainu saDakedo kantan ni wa TAIL wa furanai zeYES MAN ni narisobireta(woah oh oh, woah oh, we are bad boys)Waru ni nokosareta \"No\" to iu na no JusticeWow, Breakin' the lawBreakin' the world kowase(breaking the world)kirisake TendernessWow, Breakin' the ruleRoppou zensho ja shibarenai hanran bunshi saFuriageta nigiri kobushi ga oretachi no JUDGEMENT, Posted: 14 SeptemberIt's a great time to be a fan of RGG studios., Posted: 14 SeptemberFINALLY IT'S ON PC, I had played it on PS5 for about 50 hours barely touching the story and now I gotta grind my stuff back to where I was.. :( BUT AT LEAST IT'S ON PC and it RUNS AMAZING, Posted: 14 SeptemberI have the PS4 version of the game and actually beaten the game there. But i won't spoil story things here.But first things first, thank you SEGA for casting whatever black magic to convince the certain agency that held this game and Judgment from appearing in PC.How's the game?If you don't really like Yakuza 6/Kiwami 2 (which i am not a big fan of) combat, this game IMPROVES upon that combat a lot, as they added more fighting style in the game. In previous game, there's two combat styles, which is Tiger and Crane, both are different but unfortunately Tiger have a move that is pretty broken. But now in this game, both Tiger and Crane are pretty balanced, as they both even gained more options, also there are 2 new fighting style for this entry, a snake that have major focus on countering, and boxing which personally i haven't use a lot but from what i've seen, it is pretty broken as you can easily juggle some enemies with it. (and its originally a DLC style)Graphic wise, its Dragon Engine. The quality of Yakuza games honestly can be a hit or miss (like K2 green filter is very questionable) and personally? Lost Judgment is a hit for me.For content, this game is VERY PACKED with it. A lot of mini games and the school stories stuff, combined with side cases. Not to mention that you not only visit Kamurocho, you also get to Yokohama (as majority of game takes place there)As for story, some people actually prefer the previous entry more, but for me, I think that I prefered this plot more as I found the premise of the plot pretty grounded, and relatable.Also do i need to say somehting about the music? Well it's still a banger. Like give some of the soundtrack a listen, you'll know why. It just still have that quality that the main Yakuza/Like a Dragon games have.This game was my GOTY in 2021. And I think it will be my GOTY for this year as well (sorry Elden Ring. You're still a great game)PS: It ran well in steam deck. Finally Lost Judgment/Judgment on the go., Posted: 15 SeptemberI have always suggested the Judgement series to everyone, but I always get a bit sad how not everyone has access to them due to them being PS exclusive at the time. Now that they're finally on PC, the long-awaited dream of me suggesting this game to literally everyone has finally come.I have accumulated over 150+ hours on both Judgement(2 playthroughs) and Lost Judgement(4 playthroughs) on the PS5 in just 2 months of getting them, and now another playthrough of LJ on PC! I can never say this enough, but the gameplay and story of both games are simply fantastic. Not to mention the super stylish moves you can pull off(and of course juggling lol).A few complaints I do have for the PC port are that pre-rendered cutscenes are locked at 30 FPS and playing anything above 60 FPS will make certain things janky/weird. An example of that would be the Snake Style parry. It works normally on 60 FPS, but starts being weird at 120 (however still playable). Another issue that has plagued other Dragon Engine games would be how charged finishers(Tiger Style and maybe Snake Style specifically for LJ) would freeze the character in place if played at an uncapped framerate. So if you're having that problem, I suggest limiting your framerate to 120.Those issues aside, amazing game and story-writing. All around lovable and very well-written characters. Would definitely recommend to everyone and especially to people who enjoy stylish brawler combat set in the RGG world., Posted: 14 SeptemberSo good I re-bought it the moment it released for PC.Without a doubt the best game in the franchise, and RGG Studio's best work. Here's hoping we get a third game in the Judgment series.]  \n",

Thank you., Posted: 15 SeptemberThis is japanese Better Call Saul, Posted: 14 SeptemberAHHH AM ABOUT TO  JUDG! AM JUDGING AHHHH, Posted: 14 SeptemberOverall a great game, among my favourite RGG Studio games:- Story is among the best RGG Studio has written- Gameplay is solid (though Lost Judgment's combat is better in my opinion)- Characters and voice acting are great (English dub is solid too)- Side activities are fun and engaging as always (especially the newly introduced Dice&Cube)- Tailing missions during the main story can get kind of bothersome (thankfully this gets fixed in the sequel)- Sometimes it can be unclear what you need to search for during investigations- The evidence system is fairly simple and basic, but it's nothing too bad or disturbing]  \n",

say.In a world dominated by sprawling open world games with realistic graphics, this humble retro platformer managed to keep my anticipation for it higher than anything else for the 6 years I was waiting for its release. And you know what? It's already worth it. Highly recommend it whether you're already a fan of the first game or if you're new to the series because it delivers the same fast paced, incredibly fun gameplay of the first game with vast graphical improvements, *many* new features, quality of life improvements, and of course, the new story.Hats off to GalaxyTrail for setting a fine example for the gaming industry. It took a long time, far longer than even they anticipated, but they used that time to make sure they delivered a quality game to the fans.It's really nice to be back in Avalice., Posted: 13 SeptemberBeen waiting since 2015 when I played the first one.  Like to so far., Posted: 15 SeptemberFreedom Planet 2 is like Freedom Planet but with more Freedom. And more Planet. And more good.It's good.Go play it., Posted: 13 SeptemberJust finished the game. Absolutely fantastic, and a worthy sequel to the original. It can get hard as balls sometimes, however, just keep that in mind., Posted: 13 SeptemberAwesome game - awesome sequelFreedom Planet at one time divided Sonic fans into two camps. The first saw a solid game with their own style, the others turned on the morons and started yelling about plagiarism and parasitism on Sonic ... which, in fact, has long gone to ♥♥♥♥. However, Freedom Planet has received the recognition and love it deserves, building up a fan base that is finally looking forward to the sequel.PlotThe story starts three years after the first game. The grown up and prettier heroines are attacked by unknown robots that destroy their house. Forced to cooperate with the royal nobility, they investigate a series of incidents involving the same robots, which slowly but surely leads to key events.GameplayCompared to the first game, the combat system has been noticeably upgraded here, adding a defensive move, as well as lowering the limitation for old abilities, allowing the use of much more advanced attack combinations.The levels here are divided into two types:1) Combat - where we have to run through vast locations, making our way through their unique opponents in order to defeat the big bosses at the end.2) Urban - the most beautiful residential settlements with many characters who are ready not only to talk, but also to trade.In addition to the standard levels, there are also secondary activities, such as an arena with various modes, among which I especially liked a kind of PvP analogue that allows me to push the protagonists head-on.Graphic artsStunning sixteen-bit visuals have been pumped to perfection here, giving out not only magnificent detailed cities with civilians, but also combat levels, each of which lives according to its own laws, always remaining in motion.SoundtrackThe musical accompaniment of Freedom Planet immediately wanted to add its own playlist and the sequel took its well-deserved place in it. The soundtrack not only harmoniously combines with peaceful towns and dynamic levels, but also literally caresses the ear from the first seconds, and the sound effects are my respect.ResultsFreedom Planet 2 perfectly demonstrates to us those rare cases when the sequel not only does not lose the dignity of the original, but also multiplies them many times over, making literally everything better. This is a true creation of people who love their work and their project, and this same love does not let go even after a complete passage, as it was with the first Freedom Planet., Posted: 13 SeptemberLilac is best girl, Neera is stinky., Posted: 13 SeptemberTHE SOUND TRACKS ARE STILL BANGERS AFTER 8 YEARS!?!?, Posted: 14 SeptemberWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAHHHH BABY THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WOOOOOO, Posted: 15 SeptemberI'm not big on the 2D Sonic titles (or just in general), but the gameplay of the first Freedom Planet really enamored me and the sequel is no different.The way you create speed and carry momentum in this game is so satisfying with your attacks generally having some sort of movement property. My favorite example being Milla's Shield Burst that's so strong, it blasts you in the opposite direction you shoot it. Learn to chain them together along with her Yoshi-like float that keeps your momentum, you'll be flying across the stage at mach speed if you're good enough. Legitimately some of the best movement mechanics and physics I've ever experienced in a platformer.On top of that you have the absolutely gorgeous pixel art and incredible soundtrack. Even if you're not a fan of the Sonic titles like me, I'd still 100% give it a try., Posted: 13 SeptemberGlad my favorite indie game finally got its sequel. Goes hard so far and definitely has a lot of noticable improvements over the first title.]  \n",

exploration seamlessly blends with frequent sections that feature unique mechanics.- Solid art direction that stays consistent in quality despite the variety of styles used throughout.- An authentic rendition that, for the most part, stays true to the original SCP canons in locations and atmosphere.- High variety of settings, each built with good attention to detail.- Inconsistent voice acting that isn’t always coherent with the feelings or situations the characters are experiencing.- The SCPs chosen as ‘main material’ aren’t, by a long shot, among the more interesting or involving ones available in the lore. While well-depicted, they are comparatively bland.- Disappointing finale that feels somewhat rushed and obscure.🟨Bugs & Issues🔧Specs- Subtitles can’t be disabled.- Motion blur can be set to ‘Low’ but never completely disabled.- Mouse sensitivity resets upon each level transition and needs to be re-applied.- 3900X- 2080Ti- 32GB RAM- SSD- 1440pContent & Replay Value:It took me 6 hours to complete SCP: Secret Files (SCPSF), taking extra time to read all documents, dialogues and lore files I encountered. Given the entirely linear content, I don’t see a reason to replay once finished.Is it worth buying?Yes. The base price of 12,50€ is fair for this amount of content and quality. I can recommend buying without discounts.Verdict: GoodRating Chart HereA competent rendition of the SCP universe. It’s interesting, varied and involving, however it fails to harness this setting’s full potential.Follow our Curator page,Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews regularly.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2862523444In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingFreshly graduated from MIT, protagonist Karl Astana accepts a work offer from a mysterious company called ‘SCP Foundation’; his soon-to-be job? Archive management at one of the Foundation’s countless sites. This isn’t a run-of-the-mill archive either, Karl will soon find out, as it contains information on so-called ‘anomalous objects’: items with paranormal properties that, for one reason or the other, pose a risk for the population and need to be Secured, Contained, Protected (SCP).As an archivist, Karl won’t be involved in the dangers of direct field work, but still will have to deal with disturbing (and sometimes nonetheless dangerous) information he is tasked with analyzing and cataloging for posterity. SCPSF aims to recreate a ‘realistic’ work environment with this perspective and does so rather well, as Karl won’t only engage in his work but also have chats with colleagues he’ll eventually get to know, participate in e-meetings, receive calls and so forth. All of this contributes to giving a sense of immersion, as do all the custom interfaces that mimic internal software, detailed decor and paperwork with actual lore printed on it.The environments and the way operations are conducted, from your desk job to the interactive recollection of events detailed in the various reports, feel congruent to the SCP lore; as a longtime purveyor of this fandom, I couldn’t help but notice the great care and attention to detail put into most elements. The weaker link in all this would be the selection of anomalies, which are pretty good but don’t manage to fully convey the severity, desperation and most of all sacrifices Foundation personnel as a whole have to commit to on a regular basis.There surely were better, more interesting choices among the endless lore at the devs’ disposal. This fault is partially remedied by the solid atmosphere and care put into expanding each story’s self-contained microcosm, but still those more accustomed with this fandom will probably think of dozens better SCPs to feature.Exploration & Collectible FilesIn most instances, you’ll explore each setting in first person perspective (some exceptions apply) in a generally-linear fashion, with very few secondary areas if any at all, mostly containing additional lore files or achievement-related collectibles. The incipit will always be the same: understanding what happened during the events described in a report. For that you’ll change perspectives and play as one or more persons of interest involved in that specific case, be that a Foundation agent, a D-Class prisoner or other figures.There won’t be enemies or other dangers in most cases during exploration, save for those specific phases that revolve around avoiding an active threat, which are however sparse. At times, failing to promptly trigger an interaction can result in death, rolling you back to the last crossed checkpoint - you’ll never lose much progress given their abundant frequency.Interaction is limited, with only essential machinery or prompts being accessible in an otherwise static world - this is within expectations for what is, at the end, a narrative adventure. Instead of additional direct interactions, SCPSF uses indirect narration and environmental elements to deepen the storytelling for the more observant players. This is further compounded with plentiful optional material to peruse, such as recordings and written documents that also double as collectibles of sorts.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2862523817Puzzles & MinigamesOne of SCPSF’s key characteristics is variety: each of the various stories you’ll experience will contain minigames and puzzles each with their own unique mechanics built up from scratch. From driving a delivery truck to collect hazardous materials, to matching a melody’s notes in a rhythm game or stealthily passing anomalous monstrosities, there won’t be a shortage of diverse activities. This feature allows breaking the general conventions of narrative adventures (aka ‘walking simulators’) with novelty at every turn, while at the same time keeping the general narrative coherent.These minigames and puzzles will never be too demanding challenge-wise and the penalty for failure, as expected from this genre, is often minimal. All in all they have enough variety to break the main pacing, but at the same time are never so over-intrusive that they overstay their welcome - a mark of well-planned design.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2862523225, Posted: 13 SeptemberI am a toaster, Posted: 14 SeptemberI was excited about this game because I'm a huge fan of the SCP Foundation. However, this game doesn't incite the same feeling of excitement and intrigue I get when reading a good SCP article. It just felt... kinda boring. The game itself isn't bad, the graphics were decent and I don't think I encountered any bugs. I think the main issue is that the 5 SCPs they chose to focus on were lackluster. I'd be curious to know why they chose some of these when they had so many more interesting options available. I did appreciate the artistic choices they made, each SCP story had a distinct feel to it. They all felt unique, utilizing different art styles and tones. In the end, the gameplay behind each story just felt plodding and the content of the SCPs wasn't exciting enough to make up for it.There were some minor things that bothered me as well. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad, distinctly fake enough to pull me out of the moment. The character's footsteps, for example, just sounded really artificial and not in time with the character's movements. Normally this would be easy to ignore if they weren't so LOUD. That's another thing, the volume was really inconsistent. In one story, the music was so loud I could barely hear the characters speak and adjusting my audio settings didn't really fix the issue. Also, during one story you have to wait for text to type out before moving on and it's so SLOW (I'm already bored, stop torturing me). Not sure if there's a button to make it move faster, but if so I couldn't find it. There are also parts of the game where you're literally just reading SCP articles. It's under the pretense that you're an archivist and I get that they were trying to make you feel like an actual employee, but the 'archiving' you do is just dragging and dropping files. It's like fake gameplay and while I enjoy reading SCP articles, if I wanted to do that I can just go to the wiki.I feel bad giving this game a thumbs down because I didn't hate it (it's more meh than bad). I did get the sense that the developers were trying to make something good and I don't think the price is unreasonable.***My total playtime is probably 4-5 hrs for one playthrough, not 9.1.

What I really appreciated about this is that you really do feel like an employee of the foundation. You'll be checking on the status of SCP sites, attending training, speaking with co-workers on the instant messaging service and performing data entry grunt work in between chapters etc. It's all very immersive.Each chapter of the game has it's own visual style, gameplay mechanics, but also tone and theme. While leaning mostly in the direction of horror, there are sections that depart from the scares and feel more akin to other genres. If you've played What Remains Of Edith Finch, it's a bit similar.Although differing from chapter to chapter, each of the sections tell their story with impressive visuals and audio, while also showcasing interesting and often unique gameplay. It all seems to run very smoothly too.Each of the chapters are fun and memorable in their own way. It was a delight to play through each of them.If you're interested in SCP or you're a horror fan, what are you waiting for?GET THIS GAME!, Posted: 15 SeptemberWARNING: this game plays more like a visual novel focused on storytelling. If you come here expecting it to play like the other SCP games (which focus on surviving/fighting), you'll be disappointed.I was waiting for months to play this, and I must say, the only disappointment was that it wasn't longer. The way information is presented is engaging, and I never felt frustrated or bored even during the text intensive parts. This game also feels like multiple games combined into one, and somehow they managed to make it work. The artstyle and direction are gorgeous, so praise there as well.As for the storytelling itself... this game explores the SCP world in an honestly unique way. If you know 0 about SCP, or you only know the popular stuff from containment breach, you need not worry - the game guides you through what or who each SCP is, making it so you don't need to know a lot about the world to understand it. If you do know your \"lore\", the game is also incredible (the here be dragons segment will make anyone who  already knows the story emotional, for example).I would go more in detail, but I do not wanna spoil the game for anyone, since it's so story oriented. All in all, if you're looking for a SCP game focused on the SCPs themselves but NOT on survival horror or fighting entities, this is the game for you., Posted: 15 SeptemberSteam Page makes it sound like a collection of stories by multiple people that will keep you interested in the style of the Dread X series, however the actual game is short bursts of gameplay followed by either text based discussions or people talking at you, none of which can be skipped., Posted: 13 SeptemberI played for an hour in which no actual gameplay occurred. It started to become clear to me that this was a visual novel told though very lightly interactive parts. If you're looking for an SCP visual novel this should be great for you, but if you're hoping for anything resembling gameplay you're going to be out of luck., Posted: 15 SeptemberI am a toaster, Posted: 13 SeptemberFirst Impressions: (First Hour)The first level honestly has proven to me that this form of story telling is the definitive way SCP stories can be brought to life in such a epic and immersive way. I love the heavy emphasis on making me feel as if I am actually a part of the foundation very similar to how the actual SCP website reads. This adds an extra layer of immersion making me feel like i am a part of this world. The art style, story direction and Narration kept me on my toes from start to finish. As someone who hasn't read a ton of SCP entries, learning more about obscure anomalies in this manor was a truly great experience.I hope that this concept of a Twilight Zone/Alfred Hitchcock show Format is utilized more within the SCP universe I truly believe that this is the best fit for this universe within the gaming sphere.. heck even television. I hope this game does well so we can see maybe a Season 2 for this game or even a sequel. Well Done!]  \n",

I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Europa Universalis IV and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories., Posted: 12 SeptemberThis game is good with the expansions, buy it if you have the money for at least half of them, otherwise the you'll miss basic content like playing as a colony or having better UI with useful commands. this is a good game but a shameless cashgrab, Posted: 14 SeptemberI still haven't completed the tutorial, as the tile states i have done the missons but cant build or even find the unit availabe anywhere, WITH THE LATEST UPDATES, THE AZTECS ARE USING A CANNON, RIDING A HORSE. THERE ARE MODERN NAPOLEONIC-STYLE ARMY SYSTEMS IN CENTRAL AFRICA. THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY WRONG AND UNBALANCED. WHAT IS THIS, FRIENDS]  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  [Posted: 12 SeptemberI played through the Demo extensively, going through each of the three Class options and exploring what I could within the Demo's time limit of a few in-game Days. I had a lot of fun exploring the different options each Class brought to the game.Now that the full game has released, I decided to pick the Scribe Class, as it appeared fairly useful in the Demo. There are three difficulty settings, the easiest of which completely eliminates the full game's time limit of 40 in-game days. The hardest difficulty cuts this to 30.The UI is gorgeous, and the text can either be displayed as an old-school pixel font or a more elegant modern font. Everything is pretty intuitive, and it won't take more than a minute to navigate the entirety of the menus. The Journal option is SUPER in-depth, and a must for referencing names and places to NPCs.The ambient guitar music needs mentioning: it's not very repetitive, and it's actually quite soothing. You'll be hearing a lot of it, but with different tunes--occasionally some drums for battle, or bells/chimes for more pensive areas.It's a Choose Your Own Adventure game, with a lot of modern Quality of Life features (quick save/quick load, a fantastic repository of knowledge a few clicks away, an enormous Glossary for any lore-based terms, etc). I was told that this game has about 30 hours of gameplay, and I can believe it--especially if you play as the other two Classes, and the mechanics between the Mage, Scribe, and Fighter all vary greatly. I definitely recommend Roadwarden, especially for $10.EDIT: With some extra time to think about it, I wanted to add some things:There are some sections of the game where you will need to type out an answer to a prompt (I alluded to this feature at the end of my third paragraph). For example, you can ask an innkeeper for some gossip on characters you've met, or you may be in a strange room and the game will ask you to name what you look at. For the former, you can reference your Journal and look at Character names and type them into the prompt. For the latter, you'll need to use some detective skills and describe where in the room you'd like to look. It isn't always so simple: you can mention names to the innkeeper that aren't in your Journal yet that you only heard in passing, for example. The prompts want specific answers, but are relatively forgiving (a funny example is when a character asked me if I knew where they were from, and I had misspelled the name of their village... They corrected me, but said I was \"close enough.\" I thought that was clever).In addition, I overlooked a key aspect of the game: the graphics themselves. It's all pixel art--a lot of greens, browns, yellows, greys... But the detail of the art is stunning. Coupled with the text, you can tell exactly what's going on in the landscape you see before you. It's also incredibly satisfying to reveal parts of the otherwise black map. There's a true sense of exploration here--neither you nor your character have any clue what you have gotten yourselves into, and it's nice to have some evidence of your progress after a particularly grueling day. There are also plenty of shortcuts you can create or discover, which will make your travels much more efficient: very important, if you're playing the normal or hard difficulty.This is kind of fun, so I'll come back to this when I keep finding important things to note. Still loving it! Try the demo!, Posted: 14 SeptemberFor a game like this, you want to evaluate it along three lines. First, the quality of the writing. Second, the impact of the choices you make on the narrative. Third, the quality of the sandbox design.The writing is excellent, evocative yet punchy, avoiding flowery or purple prose. It engages in worldbuilding in a very natural fashion, never indulging in infodumps but giving you a sense of elements of the world as they become relevant. At every point I get the sense that the writing respects my time as a reader, never wasting it or lingering unnecessarily, while still giving me a strong sense of atmosphere and style.The choices feel meaningful, though this might be an illusion and I may have to revisit this after some more time with the game. I do get the sense that I'm free to make allies or enemies as I see fit, and to approach quests in my own fashion (or not at all) depending on how I prefer to engage with the world. Even the choice of what to prioritise seems to matter, since some quests come with time limits.Finally, the sandbox. The map isn't Elden Ring-huge, but it's sizeable and teeming with flavor. The characters I interact with feel lively and memorable, each with their own agenda and worldview, and even the minor locations so far in my playthrough have been interesting. I won't say there's no filler, but every location is well-thought-out and serves a purpose.In short, a fantastic game. Possibly the best of this kind I've played., Posted: 12 SeptemberVery enjoyable so far. Very polished.The UI is great and has lot's of detailed information about everything. Inventory, journal, bestiary, stats and more. Great sounds and good art to allow your imagination to fill in the rest. Will update more after my first full play thru.But I am enjoying it thoroughly~, Posted: 12 September5 hours in (out of apparently 30+) and I'm already a spy for the mayor of one village, slowly helping her build an army to force the swamp village to stop using reanimated corpse workers, among another dozen equally-interesting interconnected storylines, 10/10, Posted: 13 SeptemberWhat a great hidden gem! I love a good story, and I'm super engaged and invested in the subtle lore and world building Roadwarden offers. Gameplay is literally just making choices and managing your stats and items, but super fulfilling. The NPCs are so well fleshed out and have so much more to offer. I played 7hrs straight and Absolutely love this game.FYI: It has a built in  console if you ever need to tweak things, by pressing shift+o (the letter o).A few helpful commands are:- pc_hp = x (for example 4) for health- mana = x (magic)- coins = x- cleanliness = x- armor = x- pc_food = x (nourishment)items are all in the form of item_nameoftheitem = xso for example item_rations = x, Posted: 12 SeptemberWriting is solid and the story is keeping me interested so far. Quality artwork that gives you a framework and let's your imagination build from there. It's a nice change of pace., Posted: 14 SeptemberThis is an interactive book game. Don't buy this if you aren't prepared for a LOT of reading., Posted: 12 SeptemberFor someone with massive ADHD but a huge desire to try this out, I really hope the devs consider using the ADHD friendly font-technique calledBionic Readingsoon. It's hard to comprehend some things simply because I have to reread it, but so far I'm LOVING the game. Incredible writing.EDIT: Bionic Reading: check it outhere[www.theguardian.com]SECOND EDIT: Another helpful tool for my fellowneurodiverse friends[app.bionic-reading.com], Posted: 14 SeptemberI use this game as a tool to improve my english speaking skill., Posted: 12 SeptemberPlayed on the Steamdeck. I played both versions of the demo and really enjoyed both. I was looking forward to the release of the full game and so far it's been excellent. I really like the balance of visual novel and rpg. The setting is the kind of low fantasy I love. The developer really poured his heart and soul into this game and it shows. Highly recommended!Technical note: I'm playing on the steamdeck. Performance is great and the joystick selection is a little fiddly, but touch screen works really well and feels natural.Give the game a try!]  \n",

                                            [Posted: 10 SeptemberIt's The Witness. It would be impossible to be any more The Witness without adding an extended lecture about philosophy. If that sounds good to you, then you will enjoy it., Posted: 10 SeptemberI enjoyed a lot of the puzzles here.I do think that some of them require intuitive leaps that are not altogether satisfying - they feel like trying to guess the designer's intent rather than actually work things out logically. Even after finishing the areas, there are two puzzle types that I suspect I still understand \"wrong\", even though my understanding got me through them (at least I hope I understand them wrong, because if I don't, those are very obtuse, very inelegant rules).There is one area near the center of the map where I had to make what amounted to an aesthetic guess at what I was supposed to do. It was not a huge leap, but I found it very unsatisfying.There are also several \"Tower of Hanoi\" puzzles - puzzles where I saw the crux of it, I saw what I was supposed to do, but it was extremely tedious to manipulate all the pieces into position (looking at you, mushroom platforms). I know some people enjoy that kind of sequencing puzzle, but it was not at all what I'm looking for in a game like this.The game will inevitably be compared to the Witness, and it is just not nearly as tightly designed as the Witness is. Still, it is probably the next best thing, the art is absolutely gorgeous, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone who wanted more of these kinds of puzzles., Posted: 9 SeptemberProduct received for freeDisclaimer: I did some prerelease playtesting, so might be biased.I loved Taiji. It's similar to The Witness, in terms of both puzzle type and having to explore different sections of the world. I especially like the high density of puzzles, without filler or fluff. The world has an aura of mystery, which makes for many cool moments as you discover new areas or secrets.Puzzle difficulty is moderate -- about the same as The Witness, easier than Stephen's Sausage Roll or Baba is You. You have to discover the puzzle rules yourself (there is no text or instructions in game), and there is well-planned puzzle progression so you gradually improve your skills and knowledge. For those that want it, there are secret/extra puzzles that are more difficult.Best advice I can say is if you liked The Witness you'll like Taiji, and vice versa. Though realize Taiji is made by a one-man indie developer, so it's smaller scale / no first-person 3d graphics compared to the Witness, but that also makes the gameplay a little tighter., Posted: 9 SeptemberIf The Witness is one of your favorite games, don't miss this. It feels very similar, even though it's different enough that it's a totally distinct journey of discovery., Posted: 13 SeptemberIf you're here then you're a puzzle lover, so I'll cut to the chase. Taiji expects you to discern the rules of its puzzles on your own (a la The Witness). The issue, however, is that the game does a very poor job of communicating these rules in a natural manner. You will almost immediately begin brute forcing puzzles and then attempting to reverse engineer the mechanics, and this does not slow down ever. Even when working on the last of the game's 445 puzzles, you'll still find yourself weighing whether it'll be faster to figure out the last third of a puzzle or just work your way through the 128 permutations you've narrowed it down to., Posted: 9 September今天早上买的，一直沉浸到下午两点，witness-like的解谜是真好玩，这可比读《精神现象学》有意思多了Anyone who is interested in how language works should play witness-like games such as this one, while progressing in the game, you will always be astonished at that human mind faculty of getting a sense from everything.This is really a MEANINGFUL game., Posted: 11 SeptemberAll killer, no filler., Posted: 10 SeptemberAmazing game. Greatly inspired by The Witness but with an identity of its own. Not as many puzzles, but WAY less filler and many MANY secrets to find. 10/10, Posted: 13 SeptemberA panel-em-up island getaway where you have to flip flop these screens to make wires glow. Very delightful, and a luscious treat for the eyes. Some people say it's the same as the 1985 Harrison Ford movie, \"Witness\" but honestly I think they're only similar in a cursory way. Highly recommended (the game, though the movie is okay too)., Posted: 12 SeptemberPlay Witness - Draw linePlay Taiji - Draw boxLine - One dimensionBox - TWO dimensions2 > 1Conclusion?

       "Steelrising                                [Posted: 9 SeptemberNice enough game so far.Not at the level of what From Software makes but still decent enough and has a few interesting ideas.Assist mode is a nice addition since it lets you prevent soul loss on death and tweak enemy damage as per your liking.The compass item ensures you won't get lost.Story is nothing worth writing home about but adequate enough to keep you going.Cons:No new game plusOnly a single save slotTitan bosses could have used a bit more health, Posted: 10 SeptemberOverall, a solid souls-like.  The exploration and combat are fun and provide a fair challenge, although the controls will feel a bit stiff at first.  If you're in the mood for another souls-like and think the aesthetic and setting look interesting, you will probably enjoy this, but don't expect anything that breaks the mold.  A warning though, the game is oddly intensive in its graphics demands.  I have been able to run it fine, but others have had difficulties., Posted: 8 SeptemberThe story, atmosphere and combat feel and sound great but in it's current state I simply cannot recommend it.Constant stutters and frame drops and as soon as I left the beginning area I am getting constant crashes which is simply inexcusable with my hardware I am running.Hopefully I will be able to go back to it after some serious patches but for now, refunded.Hardware:CPU I9 12900kGPU RTX 3090RAM 32GB of DDR5 @ 6000MHZ, Posted: 12 SeptemberI finished this game last night and can now honestly put my thoughts into this review. Lots of good and some bad. I do recommend this game but on sale and for everyone interested to watch game-play reviews before buying.This game really needs a demo. The price is steep I will admit but it depends to on what you want to get out of this game. For myself it is important to have a good narrative and visuals but for others the combat is their main focus.* This game needs optimisation. I have a pretty good rig that is new. This game pushed it still. Graphically the game is gorgeous minus some of the bad facial animations and lots of glitching through items like clothes on the NPC's here and there. Otherwise beautiful for the most part.  I only crashed once in a 25 hours. So my experience was not bad, janky a bit, but overall a good experience. I know many others have had a more negative experience.* The story is the highlight of this game. Choice and consequences play into it and effect your end experience. One big negative is you CANNOT upload past saves. You only get one save (from you last checkpoint). So if you pick the wrong option in a quest and you want to back track, nope, your out of luck.  I found this out the hard way when I wanted to go back and change a option in a side quest and the option was not there.* You CANNOT respec your points. So put points into your attributes like vigour, agility and power, etc. before you put them into upgrading weapons. Both use the same in game \"currency\" to upgrade called Anima. Until you know your play style and know which weapons you want to max out. Each weapon can go up to level 5. Each attribute to level 20.* The combat feels good most of the time. It can be janky due to fps dips. You will have to fiddle around with your graphic settings, and in the menu it does allow quite a bit of flexibility to do this.The game has many side quests and some tie into the main quest at the end. The game will tell you verbally that going beyond certain points in the main quest line will block you out of certain progression in side missions. And before the final quest area in Versailles it will tell you that any unfinished quests will not be accessible beyond said point. That I appreciated since you cannot go back and load up past saves.Is this game worth it. I am more middle ground. I would say get it on sale and research before buying it. I gave it my initial two hours and loved the story and visuals. I kept playing it addicted to the story line. I wanted to see how it played out and I love the main character Aegis. I enjoyed my 25 hours despite the flaws. But you need to determine what it is you  want out of the experience and if it is for you.For those of you who are playing...savourer!  ⚔️, Posted: 8 SeptemberThis is the worst optimized game that I ever played. Stay far from this on PC till they fix the performance., Posted: 12 September\"Society seemed to be in a state of complete chaos, and honest people were left to fend for themselves, for the National Guard was made up of a strange crew, a mixture of bizarre and even frightening types. Everyone seemed to be suffering from fear; I grieved for the pregnant women who passed; the faces of most of them were sallow with worry. I noticed besides that the generation born during the Revolution  was, in general, a lot less healthy than the previous one; indeed most of the children born in this sad time were weak and suffering!\"- Mme. Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun's letter to the Princess Natalia Kurakina (Souvenirs De Madame Vigée Le Brun)Preface:Steelrising is an action-adventure game with light RPG elements and plenty of platforming where you play as an automaton in an alternative timeline where robots existed during the French revolution. To this end, the game possesses one of the most unique backdrops possible.Pros:Interesting setting.Satisfying combat.Great weapon variety.Great non-linear level design with plenty of verticality and platforming.Enemies can hit eachother, surprisingly rare in action games.Cons:Bad performance.Janky gameplay.Camera that gets in the way, all to often, of enjoying the game’s world and scenery.Invisible walls here and there.Gameplay – Combat – Character – side questsAs stated above, the player controls a unique automat; known as the Aegis, a beautiful dancer that was presented as a gift to Marie Antoinette, queen of France, to serve both as a page and a guard. This automat is not a fixed protagonist and can be slightly customized with a very barebones character creator in the beginning of the game where you can customize the Aegis’ face, hair and frame materials.The levels are dotted with checkpoints called ‘Vestals’ where automats can undergo repairs and upgrades. Each time the player rests here, all enemies respawn.The character possesses many standard attributes in RPG games, including stamina – which is contextualised in a peculiar manner to the automat; her gears overheat if she moves too much in a short span of time, herein another unique mechanic is introduced, one similar to the Ki pulse from Nioh; if the Automat runs out of stamina, the gears will overheat and lock out for a short period of time, then, the player can press a prompt to freeze the Automat’s gears, restoring a portion of the Automat’s stamina; the faster your reaction the more is restored, but the caveat is that if you press it too early the Automat’s gears will remain debilitated for longer. The most beautiful thing about this intriguing mechanic is that the player doesn’t need to look at the UI or any prompt at all to handle it; the gears themselves are a visual indicator of when to force them to freeze. Another caveat to this mechanic is that each time the player activates this ability, they will apply a frozen status to the automat, which makes her susceptible to becoming frozen (vulnerable to attack).There are many weapons in the game, each having unique style of gameplay. Some weapons are ranged (which feel like secondary weapons intended to provide support to your melee weapon). The Aegis can equip 2 weapons, and use only 1 at a time. Each weapon has a unique ability (parry, block, sword dance, etc).The game has some small errands (it’s really hard to call them side quests) scattered thereabouts in each level. They’re comically bad to the point I agreed to myself that one of them is perhaps the worst quest I ever had the displeasure of playing through; so to speak, in one of the earlier levels, a woman would call out from inside her shabby home, in her thick British accent, sparing no breath in complaining about the lack of water; the player can talk to her, and she’ll repeat her pleas for water. A “water flask” is conveniently placed nearby (a sprint 5 or so seconds for the Aegis). Upon giving the denizen this flask of water, she’ll thank you and give you 5 petrification grenades. It is worth mentioning, these NPC’s are very similar to Bloodborne’s NPC’s, whom you’d talk to from their doors, and they’d never show you their faces – you can only hear their voices. There’s many such NPC’s in Steelrising’s France, where a nationwide curfew has been ordered by Louis XVI, and the automats roam the streets having recently suppressed dissidents. In a sense, it is similar to the Night of the Hunt in Bloodborne. To this end, I believe this game is more like Bloodborne than ‘Dark Souls’.What sets this game apart?As stated above, this game makes a blend of mechanics found in Nioh with mechanics found in ‘Dark Souls’. Instead of the monotony of waiting for your energy to replenish (in this case, for the automat’s gears to cool down), you can remain directly engaged by replenishing your energy and immediately re-entering the fray. This mechanic succeeds in novelising, as it did so well in Nioh, the combat by largely obliterating those periods of inertia where the player waits for the character to catch their breath and recover some stamina to resume fighting. Given a skilled disposition in fighting her enemies, the Automat can remain in the fight all the time.In addition to this, the game possesses a real narrative and story. With plenty of characters and readable material. This includes a codex with entries for characters and world events.French History – Period – Intrigue – CharactersIf you are an avid reader of French history, this game is one of the most interesting prospects you could invest your time with. Being a person who is often had bones to pick with irresponsible handling and anachronisms in modern media in regards to history (which admittedly this game suffers from in several aspects) I found this game to be relieving; the setting isn’t just an afterthought. It isn’t “let’s do bloodborne with.. uhh… French revolution aesthetics” (then proceeds to do a hodgepodge of “aesthetics” spanning several centuries). It’s a game that has the hallmarks of being made by people interested in this historical period, and this interest is informing the game – the game being an extension of this passion, not the other way around. I knew this, the second the first cutscene panned to a framed scan of Mme. Elisabeth Vigee le Brun’s famous “Marie-Antoinette et ses enfants” hanging on the wall. The game did not stop indulging these sensibilities there – it kept introducing many significant figures from the period, starting with the famous scientist Lavoisier – contextualized in the game as someone who helped develop mechanical oils for the automats – and the Marquise de Lafayette, the man who attempted to course the revolution into moderate straits, in a role contextually similar to his real one as well, and even the Painter David receives a reference in the game. What I greatly disliked however, was how the game’s narrative paints the monarch Louis XVI as being an evil tyrant who has built armies of automats to impose himself on the French; a monarch who in reality was so harmless it cost him and many of his family their lives.Performance – Glitches – Technical issuesUnfortunately, the writing was on the wall for this game before it even released, and herein lies its single worst aspect; its terrible performance. This issue has been dismissed by some before the release during the beta, but as we stand today playing the supposed full version – it seems only slightly better, and even high end machines such as mine (R5 3600x, RTX 3080, 16gb RAM) struggle to run this game. To this end, I had wished that the developers delayed this game, seeing its state in the to make due salvaging for the technicalities of this game.Verdict;Gfx: 7.5/10OST: 7/10Story: 8/10Gameplay: 7.5/10Performance: 4/10Overall feeling (not an aggregate of the previous ratings); 7.5/10., Posted: 10 SeptemberA few opening thoughts before I get to the review :- I've not experienced any performance problems noted in other reviews. However, im running the game on medium with a beefy system (RTX 3070, 64gb ram, and a nice beefy ryzen CPU). I've not bothered putting the game on higher graphics because it doesnt look like it's super worth it.- I have a pretty high tolerance for jank in my games- I have a pretty low tolerance for bad design decisionsOn to the review :Spiders makes a souls-like, and it's .. pretty much on par with what you'd expect from a souls-like made by spiders. If you aren't familiar, spiders is a \"double A\" development studio that's made some very hit-or-miss games. Its most recent entry was Greedfall which (surprisingly maybe ?) seems placed in a very similar era and style. Where Greedfall promised a \"mass-effect\"-like experience, this one is hopping on to the \"git gud\" soulslike train, and just like Greedfall it .. sorta works. Your mileage may vary.The atmosphere, music and visual presentation is honestly on point, it's original and bold enough to actually be compelling. The narrative is alright, servicable if anything, but so far it's nothing to write home about.Where I think things start to get \"spiders\"-y is the combat -- it's stiff, really stiff. This is \"by design\" (depending on whether you believe the studio's explanation to be completely true, half true, or a lie is up to you) and meant to emulate fighting as a big ol' clunky set of gears of and whirring bits and bobs. Some weapons do feel noticably more fluid -- namely the fans and claws -- while some others feel almost unusable because of the animation commitment every single move requires from you -- namely any heavy weapon. Where things get a little out of my comfort zone however is the difficulty in understanding how enemies will react to certain attacks, and how you'll react to theirs. Much like souls-like games you've got some \"poise\" score that will determine if getting slapped will knock you straight on your robot arse, or if you're just going to trade blows and watch a chunk of your health get nipped out. For the player, this is super consistent and easy to figure out -- for enemies however, that stagger seems to be on an invisible bar (similar to the \"posture\" bar that medium weapons excel at breaking for a finisher, but not to be confused with it) that rises and falls based on the \"impact\" score of your weapon. This inconsistency is a little irksome as you need to do some mental math in order to know if its worth pressing the attack or if you need to back away for a second to avoid trading health. It isn't a dealbreaker, but these are the little details that may be dealbreakers for some.The last bit I want to touch on is the element mechanic; You get fire for damage over time, lightning for added damage per hit, or frost for (and wait for it) a complete stun for a few seconds on any enemy (including bosses!). This.. is pretty insanely unbalanced -- stacking frost on any build trivializes a big portion of the game until you find some frost resistant enemies, but then fire will be just as devastating. Your ability to abuse these boils down to whether you want to spend a few extra minutes farming for resources to just stock up on grenades, or little alchemial solutions to use your special abilities. I have a hard time justifying this completely skewed balance. But it's part of the \"spiders\" charm -- just like guns in Greedfall being absolutely overpowered, its just how it is.Overall, Steelrising is FINE, its competent, it does what it says on the tin -- here's a souls-like game with some cool twists made by a studio that's tiny. If that's your thing, great -- its not a bad romp. But for a double-A game with a triple-A pricetag, you may want to wait for a slight discount if you're on the fence., Posted: 8 SeptemberI'm loving this game.Not the hardest game, but not the easiest game.From the menu music to the in-game audio and play style.Well done!!!If you have an NVIdia card. go to advanced Video settings and set your upscaling mode to NVidia DLSS, I then use Balanced mode - this makes the game extremely smooth for meyou can also turn on ray tracing., Posted: 11 SeptemberI love everything about the game but the performance is really not where its supposed to be, I know Spiders can do better than this and I truly hope they don't run away from the project and instead keep improving the game and the performance.From DSO Gaming performance analysishttps://www.dsogaming.com/pc-performance-analyses/steelrising-pc-performance-analysis/\"At 1080p/Ultra/No Ray Tracing, there wasn’t any GPU that could offer a constant 60fps experience. Yes, both our NVIDIA RTX3080 and AMD Radeon RX 6900XT had drops below 60fps.\"\"And, as we’ve already reported, the game’s Ultra Textures require more than 13GB at 1080p. (and they can see no reason for it and that's not saying that the game looks bad, its beautiful imo), Posted: 9 SeptemberI've never left a negative review on a game before, and I don't want to leave one here, but I honestly feel like it's needed. I didn't wanna believe the reviews but this game is so poorly optimized and I'm saying that after meeting more than the minimum requirements. Also on that note, if you want to make a game available to the masses, then the minimum specs for graphics definitely should not be RTX 2060. That said, the ultra graphics of Steelrising doesn't look that good for the performance requirements, and there are other games with absolutely insane graphics and much lower requirements (needed to run them on Ultra graphics), so the minimum requirements of RTX 2060 and recommended reqs of RTX 2070 SUPER or RTX 3060 Ti makes no sense and in fact just shows a major lack of optimization. If the game was still in alpha this would be fine but releasing a game in this condition and selling it for this price is just insane. I'm sure people would have understood if the game was delayed in order for it to be optimized. Hope this game can end up improving similar to how No Man's Sky did as I really think it could work if it was greatly optimized, and if the control response as well as the lack of movement were improved.]  "
